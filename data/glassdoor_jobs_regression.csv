Counter Terrorism Policing (CTP) protects the UK – and tech is essential for their work. As a Junior Test Analyst, you’ll give officers and staff the systems to do their job, keeping the country safe.
Working with expert colleagues, you’ll provide a robust testing service, building your knowledge as you go. Day to day, you’ll test and assure a range of CTP IT capabilities, from devices and applications to systems and supporting infrastructure. Some will have been developed in-house, and some by third party suppliers, but all are mission-critical. Whatever the project, you’ll conduct hands-on testing (both manual and automated) to make sure CTP’s IT portfolio is fit for purpose after every enhancement or upgrade.
It's a great opportunity to work with our dedicated team to draw out detailed test requirements and acceptance criteria. You’ll also liaise with in-house and third party suppliers to implement test plans, so a collaborative approach is essential.
At this level, you’ll need experience of testing across multiple IT projects including web-based applications. With this background, you’ll know all about Agile or Waterfall delivery, along with test management tools such as Jira. You’ll also be used to tracking defects, functional test execution and reporting. And crucially, you’ll be a clear communicator, both in person and on paper.
Please note that security clearance is required.
Now more than ever is the time to join the Met Police. We want our team to be representative of our country and are looking to recruit people who understand and reflect the diverse communities we engage with every day.
Besides the rewarding nature of the job itself, a competitive salary and a Civil Service pension, you'll also benefit from excellent career and professional development. If you’re looking to progress, this is an outstanding opportunity.
Job Summary
There is a requirement for an experienced and security-cleared Junior Test Analyst to work within the ICT Test Team. This is an essential role providing testing services and assuring the delivery of new (and upgrades to existing) business and mission-critical CTP IT systems.
The Junior Test Analyst will work alongside members of the ICT Test Team, Business Analysts, and Project Managers, Technical, Solution and Database Architects, and other important stakeholders, to help deliver a robust and rigorous testing service to assure the successful integration and deployment of both in-house and third-party delivered software and IT solution components.
In this role, you will be required to undertake the technical, hands-on testing (both manual and automated) of a wide range of IT capabilities (e.g. devices, applications, systems, and supporting infrastructure), to ensure that CTP’s broad portfolio of IT systems remains fit for purpose following upgrades and enhancements, and that these systems continue to meet the quality expectations set by end-users.
Key Tasks
The post holder will be required to do the following:
Work alongside solution suppliers (both third-party and in-house) to assure the implementation of approved Test Plans;
Support production of required test artefacts (incl. Test Plans, Test Cases, Test Scripts, and Reports);

In approved circumstances dual nationals (of which one element is British) may also be granted access. However, in the event that potential conflicts of interest cannot be managed the post holder will not be able to see the intelligence material and will not be able to perform their duties.

Counter Terrorism Policing (CTP) protects the UK – and tech is essential for their work. As a Junior Test Analyst, you’ll give officers and staff the systems to do their job, keeping the country safe.
Working with expert colleagues, you’ll provide a robust testing service, building your knowledge as you go. Day to day, you’ll test and assure a range of CTP IT capabilities, from devices and applications to systems and supporting infrastructure. Some will have been developed in-house, and some by third party suppliers, but all are mission-critical. Whatever the project, you’ll conduct hands-on testing (both manual and automated) to make sure CTP’s IT portfolio is fit for purpose after every enhancement or upgrade.
It's a great opportunity to work with our dedicated team to draw out detailed test requirements and acceptance criteria. You’ll also liaise with in-house and third party suppliers to implement test plans, so a collaborative approach is essential.
At this level, you’ll need experience of testing across multiple IT projects including web-based applications. With this background, you’ll know all about Agile or Waterfall delivery, along with test management tools such as Jira. You’ll also be used to tracking defects, functional test execution and reporting. And crucially, you’ll be a clear communicator, both in person and on paper.
Please note that security clearance is required.
Now more than ever is the time to join the Met Police. We want our team to be representative of our country and are looking to recruit people who understand and reflect the diverse communities we engage with every day.
Besides the rewarding nature of the job itself, a competitive salary and a Civil Service pension, you'll also benefit from excellent career and professional development. If you’re looking to progress, this is an outstanding opportunity.
Job Summary

In this role, you will be required to undertake the technical, hands-on testing (both manual and automated) of a wide range of IT capabilities (e.g. devices, applications, systems, and supporting infrastructure), to ensure that CTP’s broad portfolio of IT systems remains fit for purpose following upgrades and enhancements, and that these systems continue to meet the quality expectations set by end-users.

Job Overview
We have a limited number of positions for applicants with a strong undergraduate degree in economics, but no further qualifications.
Junior consultants assist with cases, particularly with data work and industry research, as well as with general research and information management tasks. Successful candidates will be expected to rapidly take on genuine responsibility, assisting senior staff by providing conceptual and practical input to projects as required.
Junior consultants would use their programming, model building, and regression analysis skills in statistical analysis programs (such as Stata, R, or Python) and combined with their economic intuition will produce original pieces of analysis for a variety of cases across a large range of industries. They will be able to quickly familiarise themselves with client datasets such as financial, sales and survey data and identify potential issues as well as useful analyses that can be used to illustrate economic arguments. Furthermore they will be able to interact with clients and communicate economic concepts in an understandable manner while making complicated concepts and arguments approachable by non-experts. Also, assembling compelling evidence from data and research that support our expert opinions and business recommendations while working collaboratively with senior-led teams, including respected scholars and industry experts. All of the above while working in a highly collegiate and supporting environment and assisted both by peers and seniors.
Qualifications
Candidates should have (or expect to obtain) a good first degree in economics and a strong background in microeconomics, preferably with a particular interest in industrial economics. Numeracy and the ability to manipulate data and write clearly are also important. Candidates should be able to demonstrate the personal qualities that make a successful consultant.
The position is ideally suited to a candidate considering post-graduate study, but who would appreciate 1-2 year's employment experience and an insight into the world of economic consulting before returning to university for a postgraduate qualification.
How to Apply
Applicants should apply by means of a full CV and one page covering letter detailing why you are interested, and well-placed to excel, in a role with the Antitrust and Competition Economics practice in Europe. Applications will be reviewed on a rolling basis.

Collaborate with senior stakeholders across our digital experience teams to identify global business opportunities, where experimentation can accelerate our speed to value realisation.
Identify blockers in our ability to scale, and take a leading role in implementing new processes, tools, technologies, or capabilities to drive programme velocity.
Be accountable for the end-to-end analysis and reporting of global combined experiment outcomes, demonstrating ROI, operational efficiencies, and profit protection.
Act as an ambassador for experimentation across the global organisation, evangelising for its uses, educating others on the benefits of the methodology, and changing hearts and minds to become more data driven.
Report on key individual experiment outcomes, learnings, opportunities, and programme performance across the business, up to c-suite level.
Drive continuous improvement in experimentation & digital data.
Educate and enable individual product teams to better understand their experiment results, hosting training & deep dive sessions to increase organisation-wide experimentation maturity.

Key opportunities for growth in this role:
In this role, you will have the opportunity to develop and grow your data analysis skills in a FTSE100 company with big growth ambitions, with a view to longer term, moving towards either a Principal Experimentation Analyst role, or Experimentation Manager role, depending on whether the individual wishes to build deep specialisms, or move more into people management, strategy, and vision

Mentor associate and mid-level experimentation analysts, acting as their first port of call for triaging experiment analyses and helping them to develop and grow in their own careers.
Collaborate with senior stakeholders across our digital experience teams to identify global business opportunities, where experimentation can accelerate our speed to value realisation.
Identify blockers in our ability to scale, and take a leading role in implementing new processes, tools, technologies, or capabilities to drive programme velocity.
Be accountable for the end-to-end analysis and reporting of global combined experiment outcomes, demonstrating ROI, operational efficiencies, and profit protection.
Act as an ambassador for experimentation across the global organisation, evangelising for its uses, educating others on the benefits of the methodology, and changing hearts and minds to become more data driven.
Report on key individual experiment outcomes, learnings, opportunities, and programme performance across the business, up to c-suite level.
Drive continuous improvement in experimentation & digital data.
Educate and enable individual product teams to better understand their experiment results, hosting training & deep dive sessions to increase organisation-wide experimentation maturity.

In this role, you will have the opportunity to develop and grow your data analysis skills in a FTSE100 company with big growth ambitions, with a view to longer term, moving towards either a Principal Experimentation Analyst role, or Experimentation Manager role, depending on whether the individual wishes to build deep specialisms, or move more into people management, strategy, and vision

Visa sponsorships: LCCC does not sponsor visas currently so you will need to hold a valid UK passport or a valid visa to work in the UK.
Reports to: Technical Governance Lead
Role Summary:
The Lead Tester will be responsible for test frameworks to improve and optimise the systems' resilience. You will promote and advocate test capabilities, and decisions relating to tests within the context of the delivery environment.
Our current activities have been data-focused, having transitioned to an entirely cloud-based infrastructure, with some in-house development of bespoke software applications to support the CfD and CM schemes, and also underpinning the provision of meaningful business insight from our data both internally and to the wider energy industry.
As LCCC moves towards providing the settlement systems for new schemes (such as CCUS, BECCS), we will increasingly be developing our own solutions for which this role will play a critical part in ensuring these new software applications are delivered safely and securely in order to support LCCC’s strategic objective to become a centre of expertise.
As part of the Technology Hub within LCCC, the Lead Tester should work very closely with the Development team but also with the Operations Hub in project delivery, as well as the Business as a whole making sure teams understand their place in testing. The ability to work and influence internally with the business is key, as is an understanding of the wider external stakeholder environment.

Hello! Are you a data analyst who loves to work with data to uncover amazing insights on consumer behaviour? We should talk!
Element Human is a tech company that has built incredible new insight tools for the media industry, to help the world's biggest media platforms, agencies and brands understand their audiences more than ever before.

Across TV, online and social, Element Human has developed a multi-method approach to audience analysis that employs facial coding, eye-tracking, implicit association, and brand metrics. Our global client base includes media platforms that are household names, top performing media agencies, and globally successful brands. Our clients test their content - whether TVC's, branded content, social posts, pre-rolls or other - using our all in one dashboard, and use the insight to fine tune campaigns, generate creative ideas, and produce end of campaign reports.
Element Human is an example of the incredible contribution that machine learning and AI can bring to traditional research methods. Our solution makes time-consuming and costly methodologies easy: setup is simple, fieldwork runs automatically, results are processed and delivered straight to our dashboard or via our API, and the whole process is extremely cost efficient.
We're constantly innovating and pushing technology as hard as we can to build the future of ad and content measurement.

Role
We are looking for a Data Analyst to join our growing Research team at Element Human. Our Research team do the following:

Conduct bespoke research for our clients who need support with creative and ad testing.

That means bringing together survey data, emotion time-series, implicit association scores, eye-tracking, and attention scores, across thousands of consumer tests from around the world.

Our testing platform measures how people respond to content, and what that means for their attitudes and behaviour. Having this data allows us to unearth incredible insights to share with the media industry:

What emotion delivers best engagement in the US for sustainability brands?
Which social platform holds attention longer amongst older audiences?
Should an ad start with a strong emotion hook, or end with one?

The answers to these questions and more lie in our data - you just need to reveal it. Giddy with excitement? Can't wait to dive in? Then this is the job for you.

What You'll Do
Here is what you'll do as a Data Analyst for Element Human:
Analyse data produced from Element Human tests for bespoke client projects - combining data sets, analysing results, applying weights, processing/restructuring datasets, charting and reporting as required. Our data is in the form of:

Eye-tracking results
Dwell time (attention) scores
Conducting internal analysis projects, looking for meta-trends across our entire database for the purpose of industry thought-leadership.
Collaborating with the Product and Customer Success teams to ensure projects are set up correctly and carried out on time and to spec.
Consult with Product and Data Science on ways to improve our methodologies and the structure & retrieval of our data collection for effective and speedy analysis.

Our clients test their content - whether TVC's, branded content, social posts, pre-rolls or other - using our all in one dashboard, and use the insight to fine tune campaigns, generate creative ideas, and produce end of campaign reports.
Element Human is an example of the incredible contribution that machine learning and AI can bring to traditional research methods.

Should an ad start with a strong emotion hook, or end with one?

Hello! Are you a data analyst who loves to work with data to uncover amazing insights on consumer behaviour? We should talk!
Element Human is a tech company that has built incredible new insight tools for the media industry, to help the world's biggest media platforms, agencies and brands understand their audiences more than ever before.

Across TV, online and social, Element Human has developed a multi-method approach to audience analysis that employs facial coding, eye-tracking, implicit association, and brand metrics. Our global client base includes media platforms that are household names, top performing media agencies, and globally successful brands. Our clients test their content - whether TVC's, branded content, social posts, pre-rolls or other - using our all in one dashboard, and use the insight to fine tune campaigns, generate creative ideas, and produce end of campaign reports.
Element Human is an example of the incredible contribution that machine learning and AI can bring to traditional research methods. Our solution makes time-consuming and costly methodologies easy: setup is simple, fieldwork runs automatically, results are processed and delivered straight to our dashboard or via our API, and the whole process is extremely cost efficient.
We're constantly innovating and pushing technology as hard as we can to build the future of ad and content measurement.

Role
We are looking for a Data Analyst to join our growing Research team at Element Human. Our Research team do the following:

Our testing platform measures how people respond to content, and what that means for their attitudes and behaviour. Having this data allows us to unearth incredible insights to share with the media industry:

What emotion delivers best engagement in the US for sustainability brands?
Which social platform holds attention longer amongst older audiences?
Should an ad start with a strong emotion hook, or end with one?

The answers to these questions and more lie in our data - you just need to reveal it. Giddy with excitement? Can't wait to dive in? Then this is the job for you.

Collaborating with the Product and Customer Success teams to ensure projects are set up correctly and carried out on time and to spec.

Our clients test their content - whether TVC's, branded content, social posts, pre-rolls or other - using our all in one dashboard, and use the insight to fine tune campaigns, generate creative ideas, and produce end of campaign reports.
Element Human is an example of the incredible contribution that machine learning and AI can bring to traditional research methods. Our solution makes time-consuming and costly methodologies easy: setup is simple, fieldwork runs automatically, results are processed and delivered straight to our dashboard or via our API, and the whole process is extremely cost efficient.
We're constantly innovating and pushing technology as hard as we can to build the future of ad and content measurement.
