Relying on data, our Intelligence Analyst’s play a crucial role in keeping the country safe. It can be complex, but understanding it is key to the success of our operations.

If you choose the programme at MI6, you’ll work for MI6 but be based in Cheltenham for the first two years before moving to London. You’ll join a multi-organisational analysis team, playing a vital role in turning raw data into intelligence to help keep our country safe.

What skills do I need?
You don’t need any prior work experience and we don’t ask for you to be studying a specific degree, however you may find your area of study lends itself to a particular placement year opportunity. If you’re studying a Mathematics, Statistics or Economics related degree – or have aspects of these in your course, this is a brilliant internship to get you real-world, corporate experience that will provide you with lots of great experience.
Other than being eligible to complete a placement year as part of your degree course starting in Summer 2023, we’re looking for people who are self-motivated, hard-working and can communicate effectively with a range of people.

Diversity and inclusion is important to us - we’ve designed our recruitment process to be as inclusive and fair as possible.
You can join in the social side of ABI life – our Sports and Social and Health and Wellbeing committees arrange activities outside of work.
Inclusion matters to us

Roles in FSG provide a good opportunity for candidates who are interested in working in a live, high profile operational area of the Bank.
The role will involve working to strict deadlines, quality assuring, compiling, and analysing data that feed in to a variety of statistics produced by FSG. Successful candidates will have an inquisitive mind able to understand developments in the economy affect data submitted by firms, identify inconsistencies and teasing out market intelligence that will be of interest across the Bank. The role will also involve project work, which can range from developing and improving processes or creating new analytical tools, to reviewing data methodology or conceptual pieces of analysis.

The Bank values diversity and inclusion – we want to reflect the society we serve better, we want the best people to work for us and we want our workplace to be inclusive. We value all forms of diversity, including but not limited to age, disability, ethnicity, gender, gender identity, race, religion and sexual orientation. One way we support diversity and inclusion is through our staff-run networks, which are summarised here.
We are fully committed to having a diverse and inclusive working environment, and are open to considering how the role might be carried out with flexible working. This role is therefore open to flexible working patterns.
Where a role can be carried out from home, we are working towards colleagues spending at least half of their time in the office, so that we can all benefit from working together in person, while maintaining the flexibility offered by home working. From 6 June 2022, we expect colleagues to spend a minimum of 40% of their working time in the office per month. Subject to that minimum requirement, individuals and managers should work together to find what works best for them and their team.

If you choose the programme at MI6, you’ll work for MI6 but be based in Cheltenham for the first two years before moving to London. You’ll join a multi-organisational analysis team, playing a vital role in turning raw data into intelligence to help keep our country safe. Your first six months on the programme will include a mixture of formal training in technical and analytical tools as well as on the job learning.

Job Posting 13-Jan-2023, 10:33:46 AM

Directorate Overview
The Bank of England is the UK's central bank. Our mission is to deliver monetary and financial stability for the British people.
The Bank of England is a diverse organisation. Each of its 4,000 people are committed to public service and dedicated to promoting the good of the people of the United Kingdom by maintaining monetary and financial stability.
The Data and Statistics Division (DSD), part of the Data and Analytics Transformation (DAT) Directorate, is the division with responsibilities that span production and management of some of the Bank’s core datasets. The directorate more broadly is responsible for aspects of data management and data culture that reach into the working lives of almost all Bank staff. This is a time of significant change as the way we collect and manage data, and compile statistics, evolves in the light of the use of new technology with DAT at the forefront. The change draws on a wide range of skill sets, including: data management; data science; operational work; subject matter expertise in aspects of economics, statistics and banking and insurance supervision; and people and process management. The roles are in the Financial Statistics Group (FSG) whose focus is on the analysis, compilation, and publication of key statistical outputs such as monetary financial institutions’ contribution to the National Accounts, International Banking Statistics, and capital issuance.
Data compiled by FSG are used by the ONS and a variety of international organisations, including the Eurostat, BIS, IMF, and more, and feature in headline UK statistics such as the Gross Domestic Product, Balance of Payments, and UK Trade. FSG has made good progress building skills in data science applications, such as R and Tableau, in order to build new tools to better carry out the work of the group. This experience will contribute to wider divisional and directorate work, including the large project that DSD is undertaking to replace and upgrade its in-house database.
Job description
FSG is seeking proactive and highly motivated individuals to provide analytical input to the processes used to compile, analyse and publish the group’s high profile statistical datasets. Successful candidates will also find opportunities to learn and develop skills in analytical tools such as R (as well as other coding packages/tools) should that interest them. These have been used to deliver tangible benefits for the groups’ production work to date, and further examples are always being sought. Roles in FSG provide a good opportunity for candidates who are interested in working in a live, high profile operational area of the Bank.
The role will involve working to strict deadlines, quality assuring, compiling, and analysing data that feed in to a variety of statistics produced by FSG. Successful candidates will have an inquisitive mind able to understand developments in the economy affect data submitted by firms, identify inconsistencies and teasing out market intelligence that will be of interest across the Bank. The role will also involve project work, which can range from developing and improving processes or creating new analytical tools, to reviewing data methodology or conceptual pieces of analysis. As the role is part of team, good interpersonal and team working are required, as well the ability to communicate effectively.

We work together to safeguard Britain’s people, interests and businesses from various threats at home, overseas and online. To do that, we rely on data. On our Intelligence Data Analyst Development Programmes in either agency you’ll see you don’t need to be a data expert to help protect the UK - just yourself. Our operations are hugely varied, which is why increasing the diversity of our people is needed more than ever before.
To protect the UK, we need people with different perspectives and backgrounds. There’s no one ‘type’ of person we recruit. You don’t need to have coding or programming skills, but you’ll have some experience analysing data and will be keen to develop your abilities further with our support and training. You’ll have (or be expecting) a 2:2 degree in any subject or have relevant work experience.
Relying on data, our Intelligence Analyst’s play a crucial role in keeping the country safe. It can be complex, but understanding it is key to the success of our operations. And if you think you know what sort of person works in data, think again. On our Intelligence and Data Analyst Development Programmes, you’ll see you don’t need to be a data expert to help protect the UK - just yourself.
We have opportunities available in either MI5 or MI6.
The programme at MI5 is based in London and begins with a 3-month training period, where you’ll learn more about the organisation and our processes. Then, you’ll do 3 different analyst postings right in the heart of MI5. Over the course of 5 years and beyond, you’ll develop your technical skills, work with tools that can’t be found anywhere else, and gain experience to support a fulfilling and rewarding career in analysis.
If you choose the programme at MI6, you’ll work for MI6 but be based in Cheltenham for the first two years before moving to London.

We work together to safeguard Britain’s people, interests and businesses from various threats at home, overseas and online. To do that, we rely on data. On our Intelligence Data Analyst Development Programmes in either agency you’ll see you don’t need to be a data expert to help protect the UK - just yourself. Our operations are hugely varied, which is why increasing the diversity of our people is needed more than ever before.
To protect the UK, we need people with different perspectives and backgrounds. There’s no one ‘type’ of person we recruit. You don’t need to have coding or programming skills, but you’ll have some experience analysing data and will be keen to develop your abilities further with our support and training. You’ll have (or be expecting) a 2:2 degree in any subject or have relevant work experience.
Relying on data, our Intelligence Analyst’s play a crucial role in keeping the country safe. It can be complex, but understanding it is key to the success of our operations. And if you think you know what sort of person works in data, think again. On our Intelligence and Data Analyst Development Programmes, you’ll see you don’t need to be a data expert to help protect the UK - just yourself.
We have opportunities available in either MI5 or MI6.
The programme at MI5 is based in London and begins with a 3-month training period, where you’ll learn more about the organisation and our processes. Then, you’ll do 3 different analyst postings right in the heart of MI5. Over the course of 5 years and beyond, you’ll develop your technical skills, work with tools that can’t be found anywhere else, and gain experience to support a fulfilling and rewarding career in analysis.
If you choose the programme at MI6, you’ll work for MI6 but be based in Cheltenham for the first two years before moving to London. You’ll join a multi-organisational analysis team, playing a vital role in turning raw data into intelligence to help keep our country safe. Your first six months on the programme will include a mixture of formal training in technical and analytical tools as well as on the job learning.
For more information, please visit the Intelligence and Data Analyst Development Programme on our website.
The application window for the Intelligence and Data Analyst Programme will open on 6th February 2023. In the meantime, we are looking for individuals who are from an Ethnic Minority background*, to register their interest in this forthcoming opportunity. As part of the registration of interest, you will be invited to an online event prior to the campaign opening.
Please note that a registration of interest does not constitute a job application, nor will such registration have any bearing upon the recruitment process itself. Any individuals who register their interest and who decide subsequently to apply to the Intelligence and Data Analyst Development Programmes, will need to complete an application form once the window for applications has opened.

We are confining registrations of interest to those from an Ethnic Minority background only, due to their current under-representation in our workforce.

We work together to safeguard Britain’s people, interests and businesses from various threats at home, overseas and online. To do that, we rely on data. On our Intelligence Data Analyst Development Programmes in either agency you’ll see you don’t need to be a data expert to help protect the UK - just yourself. Our operations are hugely varied, which is why increasing the diversity of our people is needed more than ever before.
To protect the UK, we need people with different perspectives and backgrounds. There’s no one ‘type’ of person we recruit. You don’t need to have coding or programming skills, but you’ll have some experience analysing data and will be keen to develop your abilities further with our support and training. You’ll have (or be expecting) a 2:2 degree in any subject or have relevant work experience.
Relying on data, our Intelligence Analyst’s play a crucial role in keeping the country safe. It can be complex, but understanding it is key to the success of our operations. And if you think you know what sort of person works in data, think again. On our Intelligence and Data Analyst Development Programmes, you’ll see you don’t need to be a data expert to help protect the UK - just yourself.
We have opportunities available in either MI5 or MI6.
The programme at MI5 is based in London and begins with a 3-month training period, where you’ll learn more about the organisation and our processes. Then, you’ll do 3 different analyst postings right in the heart of MI5. Over the course of 5 years and beyond, you’ll develop your technical skills, work with tools that can’t be found anywhere else, and gain experience to support a fulfilling and rewarding career in analysis.
If you choose the programme at MI6, you’ll work for MI6 but be based in Cheltenham for the first two years before moving to London. You’ll join a multi-organisational analysis team, playing a vital role in turning raw data into intelligence to help keep our country safe. Your first six months on the programme will include a mixture of formal training in technical and analytical tools as well as on the job learning.
For more information, please visit the Intelligence and Data Analyst Development Programme on our website.
The application window for the Intelligence and Data Analyst Programme will open on 6th February 2023.

As part of the registration of interest, you will be invited to an online event prior to the campaign opening.
Please note that a registration of interest does not constitute a job application, nor will such registration have any bearing upon the recruitment process itself. Any individuals who register their interest and who decide subsequently to apply to the Intelligence and Data Analyst Development Programmes, will need to complete an application form once the window for applications has opened.

We are confining registrations of interest to those from an Ethnic Minority background only, due to their current under-representation in our workforce.

The Data and Statistics Division (DSD), part of the Data and Analytics Transformation (DAT) Directorate, is the division with responsibilities that span production and management of some of the Bank’s core datasets. The directorate more broadly is responsible for aspects of data management and data culture that reach into the working lives of almost all Bank staff. This is a time of significant change as the way we collect and manage data, and compile statistics, evolves in the light of the use of new technology with DAT at the forefront. The change draws on a wide range of skill sets, including: data management; data science; operational work; subject matter expertise in aspects of economics, statistics and banking and insurance supervision; and people and process management. The roles are in the Financial Statistics Group (FSG) whose focus is on the analysis, compilation, and publication of key statistical outputs such as monetary financial institutions’ contribution to the National Accounts, International Banking Statistics, and capital issuance.

These have been used to deliver tangible benefits for the groups’ production work to date, and further examples are always being sought. Roles in FSG provide a good opportunity for candidates who are interested in working in a live, high profile operational area of the Bank.
The role will involve working to strict deadlines, quality assuring, compiling, and analysing data that feed in to a variety of statistics produced by FSG. Successful candidates will have an inquisitive mind able to understand developments in the economy affect data submitted by firms, identify inconsistencies and teasing out market intelligence that will be of interest across the Bank. The role will also involve project work, which can range from developing and improving processes or creating new analytical tools, to reviewing data methodology or conceptual pieces of analysis.

The Bank values diversity and inclusion – we want to reflect the society we serve better, we want the best people to work for us and we want our workplace to be inclusive. We value all forms of diversity, including but not limited to age, disability, ethnicity, gender, gender identity, race, religion and sexual orientation. One way we support diversity and inclusion is through our staff-run networks, which are summarised here.
We are fully committed to having a diverse and inclusive working environment, and are open to considering how the role might be carried out with flexible working. This role is therefore open to flexible working patterns.
Where a role can be carried out from home, we are working towards colleagues spending at least half of their time in the office, so that we can all benefit from working together in person, while maintaining the flexibility offered by home working. From 6 June 2022, we expect colleagues to spend a minimum of 40% of their working time in the office per month.

We work together to safeguard Britain’s people, interests and businesses from various threats at home, overseas and online. To do that, we rely on data. On our Intelligence Data Analyst Development Programmes in either agency you’ll see you don’t need to be a data expert to help protect the UK - just yourself. Our operations are hugely varied, which is why increasing the diversity of our people is needed more than ever before.
To protect the UK, we need people with different perspectives and backgrounds. There’s no one ‘type’ of person we recruit. You don’t need to have coding or programming skills, but you’ll have some experience analysing data and will be keen to develop your abilities further with our support and training. You’ll have (or be expecting) a 2:2 degree in any subject or have relevant work experience.
Relying on data, our Intelligence Analyst’s play a crucial role in keeping the country safe. It can be complex, but understanding it is key to the success of our operations. And if you think you know what sort of person works in data, think again. On our Intelligence and Data Analyst Development Programmes, you’ll see you don’t need to be a data expert to help protect the UK - just yourself.
We have opportunities available in either MI5 or MI6.
The programme at MI5 is based in London and begins with a 3-month training period, where you’ll learn more about the organisation and our processes. Then, you’ll do 3 different analyst postings right in the heart of MI5. Over the course of 5 years and beyond, you’ll develop your technical skills, work with tools that can’t be found anywhere else, and gain experience to support a fulfilling and rewarding career in analysis.
If you choose the programme at MI6, you’ll work for MI6 but be based in Cheltenham for the first two years before moving to London. You’ll join a multi-organisational analysis team, playing a vital role in turning raw data into intelligence to help keep our country safe. Your first six months on the programme will include a mixture of formal training in technical and analytical tools as well as on the job learning.
For more information, please visit the Intelligence and Data Analyst Development Programme on our website.
The application window for the Intelligence and Data Analyst Programme will open on 6th February 2023. In the meantime, we are looking for individuals who are from an Ethnic Minority background*, to register their interest in this forthcoming opportunity. As part of the registration of interest, you will be invited to an online event prior to the campaign opening.
Please note that a registration of interest does not constitute a job application, nor will such registration have any bearing upon the recruitment process itself. Any individuals who register their interest and who decide subsequently to apply to the Intelligence and Data Analyst Development Programmes, will need to complete an application form once the window for applications has opened.

We are confining registrations of interest to those from an Ethnic Minority background only, due to their current under-representation in our workforce. Once the application window has opened, we will welcome applications from all candidates, regardless of their ethnic background, gender, disability and/or any other characteristic(s). All applications will be assessed solely on merit.

We work together to safeguard Britain’s people, interests and businesses from various threats at home, overseas and online. To do that, we rely on data. On our Intelligence Data Analyst Development Programmes in either agency you’ll see you don’t need to be a data expert to help protect the UK - just yourself. Our operations are hugely varied, which is why increasing the diversity of our people is needed more than ever before.
To protect the UK, we need people with different perspectives and backgrounds. There’s no one ‘type’ of person we recruit. You don’t need to have coding or programming skills, but you’ll have some experience analysing data and will be keen to develop your abilities further with our support and training. You’ll have (or be expecting) a 2:2 degree in any subject or have relevant work experience.
Relying on data, our Intelligence Analyst’s play a crucial role in keeping the country safe. It can be complex, but understanding it is key to the success of our operations. And if you think you know what sort of person works in data, think again. On our Intelligence and Data Analyst Development Programmes, you’ll see you don’t need to be a data expert to help protect the UK - just yourself.
We have opportunities available in either MI5 or MI6.
The programme at MI5 is based in London and begins with a 3-month training period, where you’ll learn more about the organisation and our processes. Then, you’ll do 3 different analyst postings right in the heart of MI5. Over the course of 5 years and beyond, you’ll develop your technical skills, work with tools that can’t be found anywhere else, and gain experience to support a fulfilling and rewarding career in analysis.
If you choose the programme at MI6, you’ll work for MI6 but be based in Cheltenham for the first two years before moving to London. You’ll join a multi-organisational analysis team, playing a vital role in turning raw data into intelligence to help keep our country safe. Your first six months on the programme will include a mixture of formal training in technical and analytical tools as well as on the job learning.
For more information, please visit the Intelligence and Data Analyst Development Programme on our website.
The application window for the Intelligence and Data Analyst Programme will open on 6th February 2023. In the meantime, we are looking for individuals who are from an Ethnic Minority background*, to register their interest in this forthcoming opportunity. As part of the registration of interest, you will be invited to an online event prior to the campaign opening.
Please note that a registration of interest does not constitute a job application, nor will such registration have any bearing upon the recruitment process itself. Any individuals who register their interest and who decide subsequently to apply to the Intelligence and Data Analyst Development Programmes, will need to complete an application form once the window for applications has opened.

We are confining registrations of interest to those from an Ethnic Minority background only, due to their current under-representation in our workforce. Once the application window has opened, we will welcome applications from all candidates, regardless of their ethnic background, gender, disability and/or any other characteristic(s). All applications will be assessed solely on merit.

We work together to safeguard Britain’s people, interests and businesses from various threats at home, overseas and online. To do that, we rely on data. On our Intelligence Data Analyst Development Programmes in either agency you’ll see you don’t need to be a data expert to help protect the UK - just yourself. Our operations are hugely varied, which is why increasing the diversity of our people is needed more than ever before.
To protect the UK, we need people with different perspectives and backgrounds. There’s no one ‘type’ of person we recruit. You don’t need to have coding or programming skills, but you’ll have some experience analysing data and will be keen to develop your abilities further with our support and training. You’ll have (or be expecting) a 2:2 degree in any subject or have relevant work experience.
Relying on data, our Intelligence Analyst’s play a crucial role in keeping the country safe. It can be complex, but understanding it is key to the success of our operations. And if you think you know what sort of person works in data, think again. On our Intelligence and Data Analyst Development Programmes, you’ll see you don’t need to be a data expert to help protect the UK - just yourself.
We have opportunities available in either MI5 or MI6.
The programme at MI5 is based in London and begins with a 3-month training period, where you’ll learn more about the organisation and our processes. Then, you’ll do 3 different analyst postings right in the heart of MI5. Over the course of 5 years and beyond, you’ll develop your technical skills, work with tools that can’t be found anywhere else, and gain experience to support a fulfilling and rewarding career in analysis.
If you choose the programme at MI6, you’ll work for MI6 but be based in Cheltenham for the first two years before moving to London. You’ll join a multi-organisational analysis team, playing a vital role in turning raw data into intelligence to help keep our country safe. Your first six months on the programme will include a mixture of formal training in technical and analytical tools as well as on the job learning.
For more information, please visit the Intelligence and Data Analyst Development Programme on our website.
The application window for the Intelligence and Data Analyst Programme will open on 6th February 2023. In the meantime, we are looking for individuals who are from an Ethnic Minority background*, to register their interest in this forthcoming opportunity. As part of the registration of interest, you will be invited to an online event prior to the campaign opening.
Please note that a registration of interest does not constitute a job application, nor will such registration have any bearing upon the recruitment process itself. Any individuals who register their interest and who decide subsequently to apply to the Intelligence and Data Analyst Development Programmes, will need to complete an application form once the window for applications has opened.

We are confining registrations of interest to those from an Ethnic Minority background only, due to their current under-representation in our workforce. Once the application window has opened, we will welcome applications from all candidates, regardless of their ethnic background, gender, disability and/or any other characteristic(s). All applications will be assessed solely on merit.

We work together to safeguard Britain’s people, interests and businesses from various threats at home, overseas and online. To do that, we rely on data. On our Intelligence Data Analyst Development Programmes in either agency you’ll see you don’t need to be a data expert to help protect the UK - just yourself. Our operations are hugely varied, which is why increasing the diversity of our people is needed more than ever before.
To protect the UK, we need people with different perspectives and backgrounds. There’s no one ‘type’ of person we recruit. You don’t need to have coding or programming skills, but you’ll have some experience analysing data and will be keen to develop your abilities further with our support and training. You’ll have (or be expecting) a 2:2 degree in any subject or have relevant work experience.
Relying on data, our Intelligence Analyst’s play a crucial role in keeping the country safe. It can be complex, but understanding it is key to the success of our operations. And if you think you know what sort of person works in data, think again. On our Intelligence and Data Analyst Development Programmes, you’ll see you don’t need to be a data expert to help protect the UK - just yourself.
We have opportunities available in either MI5 or MI6.
The programme at MI5 is based in London and begins with a 3-month training period, where you’ll learn more about the organisation and our processes. Then, you’ll do 3 different analyst postings right in the heart of MI5. Over the course of 5 years and beyond, you’ll develop your technical skills, work with tools that can’t be found anywhere else, and gain experience to support a fulfilling and rewarding career in analysis.
If you choose the programme at MI6, you’ll work for MI6 but be based in Cheltenham for the first two years before moving to London. You’ll join a multi-organisational analysis team, playing a vital role in turning raw data into intelligence to help keep our country safe. Your first six months on the programme will include a mixture of formal training in technical and analytical tools as well as on the job learning.
For more information, please visit the Intelligence and Data Analyst Development Programme on our website.
The application window for the Intelligence and Data Analyst Programme will open on 6th February 2023. In the meantime, we are looking for individuals who are from an Ethnic Minority background*, to register their interest in this forthcoming opportunity. As part of the registration of interest, you will be invited to an online event prior to the campaign opening.

Any individuals who register their interest and who decide subsequently to apply to the Intelligence and Data Analyst Development Programmes, will need to complete an application form once the window for applications has opened.

We are confining registrations of interest to those from an Ethnic Minority background only, due to their current under-representation in our workforce.

We work together to safeguard Britain’s people, interests and businesses from various threats at home, overseas and online. To do that, we rely on data. On our Intelligence Data Analyst Development Programmes in either agency you’ll see you don’t need to be a data expert to help protect the UK - just yourself. Our operations are hugely varied, which is why increasing the diversity of our people is needed more than ever before.
To protect the UK, we need people with different perspectives and backgrounds. There’s no one ‘type’ of person we recruit. You don’t need to have coding or programming skills, but you’ll have some experience analysing data and will be keen to develop your abilities further with our support and training. You’ll have (or be expecting) a 2:2 degree in any subject or have relevant work experience.
Relying on data, our Intelligence Analyst’s play a crucial role in keeping the country safe. It can be complex, but understanding it is key to the success of our operations. And if you think you know what sort of person works in data, think again. On our Intelligence and Data Analyst Development Programmes, you’ll see you don’t need to be a data expert to help protect the UK - just yourself.
We have opportunities available in either MI5 or MI6.
The programme at MI5 is based in London and begins with a 3-month training period, where you’ll learn more about the organisation and our processes. Then, you’ll do 3 different analyst postings right in the heart of MI5. Over the course of 5 years and beyond, you’ll develop your technical skills, work with tools that can’t be found anywhere else, and gain experience to support a fulfilling and rewarding career in analysis.
If you choose the programme at MI6, you’ll work for MI6 but be based in Cheltenham for the first two years before moving to London. You’ll join a multi-organisational analysis team, playing a vital role in turning raw data into intelligence to help keep our country safe. Your first six months on the programme will include a mixture of formal training in technical and analytical tools as well as on the job learning.
For more information, please visit the Intelligence and Data Analyst Development Programme on our website.
The application window for the Intelligence and Data Analyst Programme will open on 6th February 2023. In the meantime, we are looking for individuals who are from an Ethnic Minority background*, to register their interest in this forthcoming opportunity. As part of the registration of interest, you will be invited to an online event prior to the campaign opening.
Please note that a registration of interest does not constitute a job application, nor will such registration have any bearing upon the recruitment process itself. Any individuals who register their interest and who decide subsequently to apply to the Intelligence and Data Analyst Development Programmes, will need to complete an application form once the window for applications has opened.

We are confining registrations of interest to those from an Ethnic Minority background only, due to their current under-representation in our workforce. Once the application window has opened, we will welcome applications from all candidates, regardless of their ethnic background, gender, disability and/or any other characteristic(s).

We work together to safeguard Britain’s people, interests and businesses from various threats at home, overseas and online. To do that, we rely on data. On our Intelligence Data Analyst Development Programmes in either agency you’ll see you don’t need to be a data expert to help protect the UK - just yourself. Our operations are hugely varied, which is why increasing the diversity of our people is needed more than ever before.
To protect the UK, we need people with different perspectives and backgrounds. There’s no one ‘type’ of person we recruit. You don’t need to have coding or programming skills, but you’ll have some experience analysing data and will be keen to develop your abilities further with our support and training. You’ll have (or be expecting) a 2:2 degree in any subject or have relevant work experience.
Relying on data, our Intelligence Analyst’s play a crucial role in keeping the country safe. It can be complex, but understanding it is key to the success of our operations. And if you think you know what sort of person works in data, think again. On our Intelligence and Data Analyst Development Programmes, you’ll see you don’t need to be a data expert to help protect the UK - just yourself.
We have opportunities available in either MI5 or MI6.
The programme at MI5 is based in London and begins with a 3-month training period, where you’ll learn more about the organisation and our processes. Then, you’ll do 3 different analyst postings right in the heart of MI5. Over the course of 5 years and beyond, you’ll develop your technical skills, work with tools that can’t be found anywhere else, and gain experience to support a fulfilling and rewarding career in analysis.
If you choose the programme at MI6, you’ll work for MI6 but be based in Cheltenham for the first two years before moving to London. You’ll join a multi-organisational analysis team, playing a vital role in turning raw data into intelligence to help keep our country safe. Your first six months on the programme will include a mixture of formal training in technical and analytical tools as well as on the job learning.
For more information, please visit the Intelligence and Data Analyst Development Programme on our website.
The application window for the Intelligence and Data Analyst Programme will open on 6th February 2023. In the meantime, we are looking for individuals who are from an Ethnic Minority background*, to register their interest in this forthcoming opportunity. As part of the registration of interest, you will be invited to an online event prior to the campaign opening.
Please note that a registration of interest does not constitute a job application, nor will such registration have any bearing upon the recruitment process itself. Any individuals who register their interest and who decide subsequently to apply to the Intelligence and Data Analyst Development Programmes, will need to complete an application form once the window for applications has opened.

We are confining registrations of interest to those from an Ethnic Minority background only, due to their current under-representation in our workforce. Once the application window has opened, we will welcome applications from all candidates, regardless of their ethnic background, gender, disability and/or any other characteristic(s).

The Data and Statistics Division (DSD), part of the Data and Analytics Transformation (DAT) Directorate, is the division with responsibilities that span production and management of some of the Bank’s core datasets. The directorate more broadly is responsible for aspects of data management and data culture that reach into the working lives of almost all Bank staff. This is a time of significant change as the way we collect and manage data, and compile statistics, evolves in the light of the use of new technology with DAT at the forefront. The change draws on a wide range of skill sets, including: data management; data science; operational work; subject matter expertise in aspects of economics, statistics and banking and insurance supervision; and people and process management. The roles are in the Financial Statistics Group (FSG) whose focus is on the analysis, compilation, and publication of key statistical outputs such as monetary financial institutions’ contribution to the National Accounts, International Banking Statistics, and capital issuance.
Data compiled by FSG are used by the ONS and a variety of international organisations, including the Eurostat, BIS, IMF, and more, and feature in headline UK statistics such as the Gross Domestic Product, Balance of Payments, and UK Trade. FSG has made good progress building skills in data science applications, such as R and Tableau, in order to build new tools to better carry out the work of the group. This experience will contribute to wider divisional and directorate work, including the large project that DSD is undertaking to replace and upgrade its in-house database.
Job description
FSG is seeking proactive and highly motivated individuals to provide analytical input to the processes used to compile, analyse and publish the group’s high profile statistical datasets. Successful candidates will also find opportunities to learn and develop skills in analytical tools such as R (as well as other coding packages/tools) should that interest them. These have been used to deliver tangible benefits for the groups’ production work to date, and further examples are always being sought. Roles in FSG provide a good opportunity for candidates who are interested in working in a live, high profile operational area of the Bank.
The role will involve working to strict deadlines, quality assuring, compiling, and analysing data that feed in to a variety of statistics produced by FSG. Successful candidates will have an inquisitive mind able to understand developments in the economy affect data submitted by firms, identify inconsistencies and teasing out market intelligence that will be of interest across the Bank. The role will also involve project work, which can range from developing and improving processes or creating new analytical tools, to reviewing data methodology or conceptual pieces of analysis.

We work together to safeguard Britain’s people, interests and businesses from various threats at home, overseas and online. To do that, we rely on data. On our Intelligence Data Analyst Development Programmes in either agency you’ll see you don’t need to be a data expert to help protect the UK - just yourself. Our operations are hugely varied, which is why increasing the diversity of our people is needed more than ever before.
To protect the UK, we need people with different perspectives and backgrounds. There’s no one ‘type’ of person we recruit. You don’t need to have coding or programming skills, but you’ll have some experience analysing data and will be keen to develop your abilities further with our support and training. You’ll have (or be expecting) a 2:2 degree in any subject or have relevant work experience.
Relying on data, our Intelligence Analyst’s play a crucial role in keeping the country safe. It can be complex, but understanding it is key to the success of our operations. And if you think you know what sort of person works in data, think again. On our Intelligence and Data Analyst Development Programmes, you’ll see you don’t need to be a data expert to help protect the UK - just yourself.
We have opportunities available in either MI5 or MI6.
The programme at MI5 is based in London and begins with a 3-month training period, where you’ll learn more about the organisation and our processes. Then, you’ll do 3 different analyst postings right in the heart of MI5. Over the course of 5 years and beyond, you’ll develop your technical skills, work with tools that can’t be found anywhere else, and gain experience to support a fulfilling and rewarding career in analysis.
If you choose the programme at MI6, you’ll work for MI6 but be based in Cheltenham for the first two years before moving to London. You’ll join a multi-organisational analysis team, playing a vital role in turning raw data into intelligence to help keep our country safe. Your first six months on the programme will include a mixture of formal training in technical and analytical tools as well as on the job learning.
For more information, please visit the Intelligence and Data Analyst Development Programme on our website.
The application window for the Intelligence and Data Analyst Programme will open on 6th February 2023. In the meantime, we are looking for individuals who are from an Ethnic Minority background*, to register their interest in this forthcoming opportunity. As part of the registration of interest, you will be invited to an online event prior to the campaign opening.
Please note that a registration of interest does not constitute a job application, nor will such registration have any bearing upon the recruitment process itself. Any individuals who register their interest and who decide subsequently to apply to the Intelligence and Data Analyst Development Programmes, will need to complete an application form once the window for applications has opened.

We are confining registrations of interest to those from an Ethnic Minority background only, due to their current under-representation in our workforce. Once the application window has opened, we will welcome applications from all candidates, regardless of their ethnic background, gender, disability and/or any other characteristic(s).

IT and Business Change

innocent started with a simple mission: to make drinks that make it easy to do yourself some good. In 1999 we concocted a few smoothies in our kitchen and tested them on people at a music festival; today we’re blending every type of fruit & veg under the sun and selling drinks right across Europe. We have great ambitions: to show the world that you can build a successful business that cares about more than just profit, and to leave things better than we find them. We’re proud to call ourselves Europe’s favourite little healthy drinks company, but we’re still growing. And that means we need more brilliant people who share our ambition, to join in with the next, most exciting, part of our story.
what you'll be doing
innocent have undergone a large programme of work to transform the systems and processes that sit at the heart of our business and support the running of a brand new factory (the blender). Alongside this we’ve also created the brand new Data & Analytics team to leverage the power of the data these systems provide.

We are now looking for an accomplished Project Manager, reporting into the Data & Analytics lead, to support our project delivery and hit our long term roadmap. Success will mean our data, and the insights it can provide, becomes embedded into innocent’s culture, ultimately making it easy for our people to work smart.

From the initial ideas right through planning, building, testing, go-live, business handover and project closure, you’ll be making sure we hit our milestones, manage our risks and issues, navigate around unplanned changes and keep our stakeholders informed. And deliver great results that make everyone’s working lives that bit easier.

you'll have
Project Management experience
Experience or an interest of working on data / analytics projects
Understanding of and confidence using standard project methodology, process, and frameworks
Pride in your attention to detail, organisation, and proactivity
Strong stakeholder management and influencing ability across all levels of the business
Comfort with conflict, bringing people together to resolve issues and hold them to account
It would be ideal if you'd have:
Knowledge of Power BI and Microsoft D365

you'll get
An opportunity to join a brand new team (Data & Analytics) where you can have a real impact from the start, making the most of your skills and delivering real value across all areas of the business.

We’re relatively early in our data and analytics journey but this position will play a key role in developing our capabilities into new and exciting areas.

What’s more, you will be a part of the wider project management community with plenty of opportunities to learn and develop your career.

You will help us to keep doing business the right way – keeping innocent one of the Sunday Times Best Places to Work, using our B Corp status to inspire wider change, and reinforcing our culture of staying little as we grow big. At innocent, it’s the relationships and friendships we create while working together, that make us who we are. It’s why we love hybrid working – a mix of connecting in person and remotely. We’re also aware that the world is changing, and we all want and need different things from our work and home lives. So, if you need to walk the dog, go to the gym, or have commitments outside of work, we’re open to talking through flexible working options that work for you and us.
In return for everything you can bring, we can offer you an exciting, challenging role in a fast-growing and dynamic business, with plenty of career opportunities in the UK and across Europe as well as a competitive rewards package. We also have some great clubs, a free breakfast and as many smoothies as you can shake a stick at. Take a look at our reward page for more details.

If you think you have everything we're looking for and more, then we'd love to hear from you.

You'll need to get your skates on though, as applications close soon.
