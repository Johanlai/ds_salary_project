Presenting experiment learnings to select audiences
Participate in cross-functional working groups with other departments (Product, Operations, Marketing, etc.) to share and bring in learnings from the work being undertaken in different parts of the business.

FairHeat Limited,Project Manager,"London, England",£45K - £55K (Employer Est.),"£52,500 /yr (est.)",-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,"FairHeat is a heat network consultancy playing a leading role in the decarbonisation of heat in the UK.
Founded in 2015 by innovators in the sector, FairHeat has rapidly established itself as the leading experts on how to specify, design, delivery and operate low temperature heat networks in the UK. This has received wide recognition within the industry, with FairHeat receiving multiple awards, including ADE Consultancy Project of the Year (2016), ADE Innovation of the Decade (2017), Network Awards Heat Network of the Year (2019), CIBSE Employer of the Year (2019, 2021) and CIBSE Building Performance Award – Collaboration (2022).
FairHeat’s data-based approach is one of its key points of differentiation in the heat network industry, with unparalleled access to performance data.
FairHeat is also well known for its innovative approach in developing and deploying standardised processes that improve system outcome, particularly with respect to commissioning processes. As an example, FairHeat developed a standardised Acceptance Testing process, which has just been adopted as a minimum requirement within the latest version of the CIBSE Heat Network Code of Practice (CP1 2020).
In contrast to most design consultancies in the sector, FairHeat is positioned as client representative, working with other design consultancies and contractors to ensure optimum results for clients. Primarily focused on London, FairHeat has many of the largest London based social housing organisations and private developers as clients. There are two main parts to the business: (1) A New Build practice, focused on supporting clients from specification through to system commissioning; and (2) an Operations practice focused on ensuring that systems perform well, with a heavy focus on improving the performance of poorly performing legacy systems.
In line with its success in the market, FairHeat has experienced rapid growth and is looking to support the ongoing development of the business by bringing in additional talent.
The Role
The Project Manager reports to Head of Delivery and is responsible for ensuring the project deliverables she/he works on meet the client requirements and are delivered safely, on time and within budget across a wide range of activities.
The role will require a mix of project management, technical engineering and strong stakeholder management. You must be proactive and comfortable working with minimal supervision, but also understand your own limitations and seek support/approval when required. You must be engaged in your own personal development, as it is essential the Project Manager has a strong technical and commercial understanding of most of the areas and services that FairHeat manage.
The Project Manager will look after a range of live heat network construction projects of the following typical scope:
Plantroom and network end of life equipment replacements.
Full plantroom and network retrofits to improve performance (e.g. Heat Network Efficiency Scheme funded projects).
Heat pump retrofits to decarbonise existing buildings (e.g. PSDS project delivery management).
HIU and heat meter upgrade/replacement works.
District Heating project installations, including energy centres, buried networks and substation plantrooms.
Duties & Responsibilities
Core Role
To manage the above projects, you will be expected to:
Manage a ranch of projects, with multiple live contracts at different stages of design/construction/commissioning.
Oversee and monitor the Health & Safety management of the project, ensuring the relevant RAMS are in place for all internal and external works and all near misses, incidents and accidents are reported in line with the relevant processes.

Monitor and measure project expenditure against budgets throughout the project lifecycle and report to line management.
Develop and maintain effective working relationships with Clients and other key stakeholders.
Advice our clients on their CDM 2015 duties and provide support as required to assist them with the management of these duties.
Manage tender processes for both design and contractor packages, including preparation of bid materials, review of tender responses, responding to RFIs and making recommendations to the Head of Delivery on appointments.
Overall contract management to ensure the work is being delivered in line with the contractual scope/appointments.
Manage the projects during delivery. This will involve ensuring the contracted scope is delivered within the agreed budget and timescales. You will be expected to own and manage the project risk registers and use these as your primary communication tool to internal and external stakeholders on project risks, delays, changes and opportunities.
Ensure the projects have sufficient resources allocated to them, and that the resources have suitable experience, competence and training to deliver the scope of works under the contract. This will involve the production and management of project programs/Gantt charts/coordinated resource plans.
Due to the nature of the role, you also be expected to take technical ownership on the onsite Quality Assurance of the delivered system. This will involve coordination and management of FairHeat’s engineering resource to support as necessary, but you will be responsible for:
Administration of FairHeat’s industry leading Employer’s Requirements for heat networks.
Ensuring the technical submittal and contractor design approvals process has been complete before purchase or installation of equipment.
Ensuring method statements have been approved before commissioning activities commence.
Ensuring water quality is being monitored onsite and the results are within the contracted KPI limits.
Ensuring the installation has been inspected and signed off at the contractual milestones prior to handover.
Ensuring the contractual KPIs have been independently tested by FairHeat prior to handover, such as Acceptance Testing and plantroom load testing.
Ensuring the O&M manuals and as built documentation is provided prior to final contactor payment.
Communication, management and resolution of any snags/issues/remedial measures that arise from the above Quality Assurance process.
In addition, you will have responsibility for managing key clients, involving building client relationships and producing proposals that match FairHeat services with their requirements.
The Project Manager is expected to provide mentorship to all engineers, ensuring the upskilling and knowledge growth of these individuals. You will also be expected to support the wider team in developing Project Management competence within the business.
It is expected that the Project Manager will develop into a leading expert within the market with regards to heat network construction, performance monitoring and the cost and effectiveness of implementing different types of physical interventions to heating systems and component equipment (e.g. HIUs). As part of this, you will be expected to support FairHeat in their industry initiatives, which includes technical webinars to CIBSE, steering committee members of various working groups/technical standards and marketing events.

FairHeat Limited,Project Manager,"London, England",£40K - £50K (Employer Est.),"£52,500 /yr (est.)",-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,"FairHeat is a heat network consultancy playing a leading role in the decarbonisation of heat in the UK.
Founded in 2015 by innovators in the sector, FairHeat has rapidly established itself as the leading experts on how to specify, design, delivery and operate low temperature heat networks in the UK. This has received wide recognition within the industry, with FairHeat receiving multiple awards, including ADE Consultancy Project of the Year (2016), ADE Innovation of the Decade (2017), Network Awards Heat Network of the Year (2019), CIBSE Employer of the Year (2019, 2021) and CIBSE Building Performance Award – Collaboration (2022).
FairHeat’s data-based approach is one of its key points of differentiation in the heat network industry, with unparalleled access to performance data.
FairHeat is also well known for its innovative approach in developing and deploying standardised processes that improve system outcome, particularly with respect to commissioning processes. As an example, FairHeat developed a standardised Acceptance Testing process, which has just been adopted as a minimum requirement within the latest version of the CIBSE Heat Network Code of Practice (CP1 2020).
In contrast to most design consultancies in the sector, FairHeat is positioned as client representative, working with other design consultancies and contractors to ensure optimum results for clients. Primarily focused on London, FairHeat has many of the largest London based social housing organisations and private developers as clients. There are two main parts to the business: (1) A New Build practice, focused on supporting clients from specification through to system commissioning; and (2) an Operations practice focused on ensuring that systems perform well, with a heavy focus on improving the performance of poorly performing legacy systems.
In line with its success in the market, FairHeat has experienced rapid growth and is looking to support the ongoing development of the business by bringing in additional talent.

The Project Manager will look after a range of live heat network construction projects of the following typical scope:
Plantroom and network end of life equipment replacements.
Full plantroom and network retrofits to improve performance (e.g. Heat Network Efficiency Scheme funded projects).
Heat pump retrofits to decarbonise existing buildings (e.g. PSDS project delivery management).
HIU and heat meter upgrade/replacement works.

The Government launched its Transparency Pilot Scheme on International Women’s Day 2022 as part of its initiative to level up. The scheme aims to support objectives around Gender Pay Gap by encouraging organisations to promote transparency with salaries when advertising any job roles. Evidence shows that by stating salaries on job adverts, Women can negotiate pay on a fair basis. At CCG our objective is to be Employer of Choice, through our passion and dedication to Diversity, Equality and Inclusion recognising everyone is different together.
Don’t think you meet all the skills and qualifications listed?
