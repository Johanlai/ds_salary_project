Our goal is to bring compensation into the modern age by building the ultimate real-time compensation solution.

Masters or PhD in data science, statistics, or a related field
Strong background in statistics and machine learning
Familiarity with Python and relevant data science libraries (e.g. scikit-learn, pandas, numpy)
Ability to work independently and collaborate effectively in a multi-disciplinary team

What you’ll get:
The opportunity to be part of the early team of a category-defining company backed by a strong roster of world-class investors
An inclusive work environment characterised by a high degree of trust, respect and integrity
The ability to work closely with and learn from the company’s founders as well as a highly ambitious team of smart, mission-driven individuals

Job Posting 16-Jan-2023, 7:21:01 AM

The Bank of England is the UK's central bank. Our mission is to deliver monetary and financial stability for the British people.
The Bank of England is a diverse organisation. Each of its 4,000 plus people are committed to public service and dedicated to promoting the good of the people of the United Kingdom by maintaining monetary and financial stability.

We are actively seeking the benefits of having a range of backgrounds and characteristics in our teams. Diverse teams are more inclined to consider novel ideas and challenge each other, enabling them to infer cause and effect and to solve problems better and thereby help us to better achieve our mission.

The Bank values diversity and inclusion – we want to reflect the society we serve better, we want the best people to work for us and we want our workplace to be inclusive. We value all forms of diversity, including but not limited to age, disability, ethnicity, gender, gender identity, race, religion and sexual orientation. One way we support diversity and inclusion is through our staff-run networks, which are summarised here.
We are fully committed to having a diverse and inclusive working environment, and are open to considering how the role might be carried out with flexible working. This role is therefore open to flexible working patterns. (Delete if operationally this may not be feasible)
Where a role can be carried out from home, we are working towards colleagues spending at least half of their time in the office, so that we can all benefit from working together in person, while maintaining the flexibility offered by home working. From 6 June 2022, we expect colleagues to spend a minimum of 40% of their working time in the office per month. Subject to that minimum requirement, individuals and managers should work together to find what works best for them and their team.
We are also committed to making adjustments for candidates and employees where possible, and have partnered with external expert organisations to support us in this. We are a member of the Disability Confident scheme, summarised here, and people who wish to apply under this scheme should check the box in the ‘Candidate Personal Information’ under the ‘Disability Confident Scheme’ section of the application.
We anonymise applications so hiring managers will not be able to see your personal information when reviewing your submission, including your CV. Please fully complete the application form questions as requested, as any incomplete submissions may not be reviewed.
The Bank of England is a distinctive institution and our rewards are one of the things that set us apart. As well as enjoying a competitive salary you will work in a collaborative, inclusive environment, with a subsidised restaurant, flexible working opportunities and plenty of wellbeing initiatives.
This specific role offers a base salary of £41,270 to £48,870 per annum, along with our comprehensive benefits package as follows:
A non-contributory, career average pension giving you a guaranteed retirement benefit of 1/95th of your annual salary for every year worked. There is the option to increase your pension (to 1/50th) or decrease (to 1/120th) in exchange for salary through our flexible benefits programme each year.

A 7% benefits allowance with the option to take as salary or purchase a wide range of flexible benefits.
25 days annual leave with option to buy up to 13 additional days through flexible benefits.
Private medical insurance and income protection.

Further information of vetting and security clearance requirements for the role will be provided to the successful applicant. Further information about how the Bank processes personal data for these purposes, is set out in the Bank’s Privacy Notice at Privacy and the Bank of England | Bank of England.

Visit our “Join Us” section on our website to see how we expand on these core values and find out more about us.

From our CEO, Luke Kennedy:
“During my time in government and business, I helped Ministers, industry leaders and global investors make strategic decisions. Too often, these decisions were based on data sets that are small in sample, stale and skewed. This leads to sub-optimal decisions on matters of policy, capital allocation and commercial strategies – ultimately negatively impacting economic growth, job creation and levels of investment into public services. I was frustrated and at times very worried and believed there must be better data out there. This is why I set up Fable Data. We are working with technology and financial partners from across Europe to build anonymous consumer data sets that are real-time, large-scale, accurate and predictive. We can see the economy in real-time. There are many commercial applications for this data, but my personal mission is to get this data into the hands of decision-makers everywhere, as better data will lead to better decisions, and I believe, a better world.”

Step into a universe like no other.

Job Specification

We’re seeking a freelance data scientist to consult and advise our in-house data team of data engineers, analysts and software developers. Initially we need data science support on a specific project that runs over the next 3 months, but we will have need of more support in the future and hope to find someone we can call on again.

Brave Bison builds and manages the strategy, delivery and reporting of multiple digital marketing channels for major website such as Currys, New Balance and Furniture Village. As part of this, we collect, process and interpret a vast quantity of data ranging from Google rankings to online product sales data. In general terms, we need data scientists to help us when it comes to advanced interpretation of this data and using it for automation.

2 specific projects we’re recruiting for right now requires data science input into these areas:

OneSearch Project

The assessment of dozens of data points to automatically suggest when Branded PPC ads can be turned off - on the basis that the sales that would have been generated from the ads will anyway be gained from organic Google rankings (SEO) – and turned back on again should the data suggest those sales are subsequently at risk.
Once implemented, measuring the outcome of those suggestions in a way that captures the complexity of multi-channel digital marketing with an appropriate attribution model.
Using the measurement outcome in a feedback loop that can change what actions the system suggests.
We have no fixed idea about how to approach these steps, so you will have a free hand in designing how we accomplish the desired outcomes.

Data Driven Attribution and Measurement Project

Somewhat related to measuring impact of ‘removal’ effect above in OneSearch we’re looking to build a data driven attribution model for one our key clients to help them inform and justify investment in awareness channels
Channel path data is being centralised in a CDP which becomes the one-stop view of multiple channel interactions which the model will base its estimation off
Unlike how other off-the-shelf attribution modelling providers suggest the impact of first touch channels over last touch channels; we want to be able to accurately recommend budget levels at tactic (prospecting/retargeting/KWs), channel (PPC, Display, Social) and Product Levels (SKU1, SKU2 etc…)
Furthermore, we would like to predict the point of diminishing returns for specific channel or tactic or product

We’ve previously built some internal apps for this through R and already have the complex calculations in place alongside the model adopted. You’re more than welcome to build on this or suggest a route that would allow us to get an effective and scalable solution rolled out efficiently.

Our teams will implement your design and we want you to be on hand throughout the implementation, testing and launch phases and to conduct regular check ins to ensure your design has been implemented and is working as intended.

You will report to and work primarily with the Head of Data, and also work with data engineers from the Data team and the heads of our SEO, PPC and Display teams. The other main stakeholder will be the Head of Special Projects – a function that oversees the development of innovative new tools, processes, and products in the business.

Desired behaviour’s & traits:

Enthusiastic, committed, and proactive
Methodical, analytical and accurate, with great attention to detail
Willing to speak out when something isn’t right, while showing respect for others’ points of view
Own and take pride in your work
Communicates clearly and concisely in writing and in person

Skills & experience we’re looking for:

Working with, interpreting, and using data for digital marketing attribution and measurement
Experience in projects involving various models for marketing mix modelling (provide insights into the cause and effect of digital marketing investments) and data driven attribution (accurately attribute credit for multiple channels to inform optimal budgeting decisions).
Experience in projects involving Markov’s Chain, Shapely Values, CLV/LTV models and models accuracy
Machine learning
Python
Setting up, administering, and maintaining cloud servers and databases (particularly AWS and Google Cloud)
Troubleshooting applications and codebases to quickly identify and resolve issues
Experience working in a project environment, including requirements gathering with business users and testing and deployment cycles.

Learn about Data & AI at Avanade:
Today, analytics and AI are the great equalizer, where smaller organizations can create big presence and big companies can create intimate connections. In a study conducted by Avanade on [1] AI Maturity, 97% of organizations are evaluating the work AI could do - or augment humans to do.

While many organizations dream of the potential benefits from data & AI, Avanade makes that a reality, helping them bring real business value, and enabling business transformation, using data. Our capabilities, from robotic process automation, to business analytics, predictive analytics, data visualizations, data warehousing and more, help bring unprecedented insights to life and enable rapid, high value, data driven decision making.

And importantly... what do we stand for?

Together we believe everyone counts.

We believe in diversity. Diverse teams and an inclusive environment are critical to innovation and future growth. Our mission is to create an environment where employees can do their best work.

We know that a chorus of different voices makes for a richer sound. We want you to be comfortable being who you are at work. That means being in an environment where everyone else is free to be who they are, too.

Together we connect.

Yes, we appreciate a variety of perspectives—it adds richness to our work. And yes, we understand that there are huge upsides to connecting with people who know where you’ve been and what it’s like to be you. That is why we have a bunch of employee networks where people can come together through that avenue of shared interests, background, and experiences. Employee groups do great things to create a more diverse, understanding, celebratory workforce.

Together we become a part of something bigger

Joining Avanade means sharing our purpose—to make a genuine human impact—and helping us become a more responsible business.

We want you to experience the joy of family dinners, the thrill of outdoor adventures, the connection of volunteering in our communities, and the importance of self-care. You can’t be who you are without a flexible culture that allows you to log on when and where you work best. Because we know your best self does your best work.

Visit our “Join Us” section on our website to see how we expand on these core values and find out more about us.

From our CEO, Luke Kennedy:
“During my time in government and business, I helped Ministers, industry leaders and global investors make strategic decisions. Too often, these decisions were based on data sets that are small in sample, stale and skewed. This leads to sub-optimal decisions on matters of policy, capital allocation and commercial strategies – ultimately negatively impacting economic growth, job creation and levels of investment into public services. I was frustrated and at times very worried and believed there must be better data out there. This is why I set up Fable Data. We are working with technology and financial partners from across Europe to build anonymous consumer data sets that are real-time, large-scale, accurate and predictive. We can see the economy in real-time. There are many commercial applications for this data, but my personal mission is to get this data into the hands of decision-makers everywhere, as better data will lead to better decisions, and I believe, a better world.”

All work and no play just isn't our style! We're already planning our future ways of working, for when life becomes a little more normal again. We're constantly evolving our approach to enable you to find a great work life balance.

We're building the infrastructure for the net zero transition, and we're looking for brilliant builders who want to help define a low carbon future.
Decarbonizing the economy requires a granular, real-time view of where emissions come from and how they might be reduced. We build software to automate the carbon footprinting of supply chains. Banks, traders, and manufacturers use our product to tame the complexity of international supply networks, identify the most carbon-intensive parts, and find greener alternatives. Having developed technology which is significant in advance of competitive solutions, we are now investing heavily in market adoption.

You can find out more about interviewing at CarbonChain at https://www.carbonchain.com/careers/interview-process.
To join Carbon Chain, you'll be a keen technologist who loves to learn from others. Our company is made up of 10 passionate people with expertise ranging from oil refining to deep learning. Between us we've run Amazon's European supply chain, built JustEat's corporate meal delivery platform, and monitored industrial emissions with satellites for Al Gore. We've got MBAs and PhDs but we know that there's a lot we don't know, and we're hoping you can help fill that gap.
What will you be responsible for at Carbon Chain?
As the world wakes up to the reality of climate change and the need to decarbonize, there's a pressing need to understand the carbon intensity of every activity in the economy. Your job as Data Scientist is to build the datasets, models, and pipelines we need to provide that understanding.
We're a small team of versatile technologists and we don't believe in a siloed approach. Our data scientists sit side by side with software engineers and designers, making sure that we have the data we need to provide the experience our customers want. You'll be deeply embedded in the product team, with your work being deployed to clients every week. You'll work closely with our domain experts, and have the chance to present to clients if that's something that excites you.
You can expect to have:
Ownership of your projects
An independent path to production
The ability to make real changes with tangible business value
Our data science stack is predominantly Python. We deploy our work in a variety of ways depending upon the challenge, from Lambdas to Docker containers. A typical service might pull together a mix of data from relational and non-relational databases, train a machine learning model nightly, and expose predictions via a Lambda function. We've got a huge number of exciting things to build, from interactive visualizations of industrial processes to fluid-dynamics models of shipping emissions.
Our only must-haves are possessing a hunger to solve business challenges using technology, the ability to build close relationships with your team, and the right to work in the UK.
Which tools, technologies, and processes will you work with?
Data processing with the standard scientific stack (Pandas, Numpy, Scipy) and beyond
Machine learning in Sklearn and (rarely) Pytorch
Data visualization with Plotly, Maptlotlib, and Altair
Containerised applications are the key to our technology vision allowing us to replicate production environments locally and scale services at will.
Object-oriented code forms the bulk of our codebase.
PostgreSQL and DynamoDB managed databases form the persistence layer - you'll learn to navigate document and relational databases and appreciate the values in both worlds.
Infrastructure automation is owned by the whole team, helping to spread the DevOps mentality across the whole technology department (and beyond).
Testing approaches from unit testing to integration testing are key to delivering reliable and maintainable solutions.
Quality assurance is owned by the team themselves - we believe that full cycle product ownership should sit tightly within the team.
Agile development, using various approaches from Scrum to Elephant Carpaccio, helps us deliver software in small iterations, learning and course-correcting in the process to make sure we deliver the right improvements.
GitHub PRs are an integral part of our core development flow - with reviews to help share knowledge and improve quality.
Continuous delivery is the approach we strive for - with metrics that help us optimise parts of the pipeline that need it the most.
Teamwork and collaboration are fundamental to the delivery of our solutions. We encourage solutionizing between the team and the wider business.
You don't need to be a pro at all of these skills to apply for the role, but we'd love to hear about any relevant knowledge and experiences that you have in these areas.
What we require from applicants
Right to work in the UK and willingness to come to London office 2+ days a week
1+ years of commercial Data Science experience
A passion for environmental issues
A demonstrated interest in building products and collaborating tightly with engineers
The grit and energy to work in an early stage startup
What we're offering
Competitive salary + generous equity package
Flexible working hours - we encourage regular breaks and being AFK (away from keyboard) to support your wellbeing
Flexible working location (we like to meet in the office couple of times every week)
£1000 annual development allowance for you to spend on developing your current skills and learning new things
Tech equipment of your choice
Team lunch on Wednesdays, and frequent pub trips
Pakt coffee and snacks of your choice in the office
26days holiday + bank holidays
We're striving to build a diverse team and we would love to hear from applicants from backgrounds less frequently represented in technology, be that in terms of gender, race, or professional background.
If you think your skills and experience match what we're looking for and you'd like to join a Carbon Tech industry unicorn, please get in touch!

Visit our “Join Us” section on our website to see how we expand on these core values and find out more about us.

From our CEO, Luke Kennedy:
“During my time in government and business, I helped Ministers, industry leaders and global investors make strategic decisions. Too often, these decisions were based on data sets that are small in sample, stale and skewed. This leads to sub-optimal decisions on matters of policy, capital allocation and commercial strategies – ultimately negatively impacting economic growth, job creation and levels of investment into public services. I was frustrated and at times very worried and believed there must be better data out there. This is why I set up Fable Data. We are working with technology and financial partners from across Europe to build anonymous consumer data sets that are real-time, large-scale, accurate and predictive. We can see the economy in real-time. There are many commercial applications for this data, but my personal mission is to get this data into the hands of decision-makers everywhere, as better data will lead to better decisions, and I believe, a better world.”

Hybrid role

About Sika
Sika is a specialty chemicals company with a leading position in the development and production of systems and products for waterproofing, bonding, sealing, damping, reinforcing, and protecting in the building sector and motor vehicle industry. Sika has subsidiaries in 101 countries around the world and manufactures in over 300 factories. Its more than 27,000 employees generated annual sales of CHF 9.3 billion in 2021.

About the role.
The role centres around the investigation of cutting-edge data science techniques to drive operational efficiency and sustainability initiatives in the manufacture of cementitious products. As part of the R&D network, you will be instrumental in ensuring Sika's trajectory towards becoming the standout low-emissions, high-efficiency supplier of cement-based systems.

Purpose of the Role
The R&D/Data Science student internship has been running for a number of years and has become a critical component of our operations. Students split their time between leveraging data science techniques in order to improve our understanding of industrial raw materials and streamline our portfolio and processes, and working in the laboratory to test their predictions, improving old products, and even designing new ones.
What’s In it for You?
The Opportunity:
Actively pursue an understanding of data science techniques and how they can be utilised in chemical and industrial processes
Spend time working in a research environment, developing a strong knowledge of how different ingredients affect the properties of final products, and the interplay between them
Ideate with a focus on how we can aid in the solution of complex problems using data science, machine learning or AI
Design testing protocols and scrupulously adhere to them, ensuring that your data collection is consistent and complete
The Rewards:
You will be rewarded with a competitive salary, and a sweep of great benefits. We pride ourselves on our total reward package:
Holiday 25 days rising to 28 days with service, plus bank holidays
Hybrid Working
Core Hours Working between 10.00-16.00
A company pension contribution of up to 10%
Private healthcare for you, with option to add family
Group life cover at 6x your annual salary
Global Income Protection (PHI)
Enhanced maternity and paternity pay
Staff discount platform & Cycle to Work scheme
Dedicated Service Awards for reaching key milestones
Selected discounted Sika products
The Support:
You will join the data science unit of Sika UK, which is nestled inside the greater R&D team. Your primary mentorship and supervisor will come from the members of the Data Science unit, but the R&D team will be constantly present, teaching you laboratory techniques and ensuring the social aspect of your hybrid working experience is not lost. The manager of R&D will be your senior line manager. Sika R&D operates under a no doors policy, meaning we are always available to talk.

The Skills:
Joining the R&D / DS team will give you an insight into the different worlds of industrial research, operational logistics and data science. You will come away with a multitude of new skills, in areas including data manipulation; the fundamentals of machine learning; knowledge of cementitious chemistry; understanding of standards and safe manufacturing processes, not to mention significant experience in laboratory and digital work. Each intern has been a success story, boasting achievements from designing new product lines to finding new raw materials that could revolutionise national industry. A significant commitment to professional and personal development from day one.

The Future:
The possession of deep knowledge in the topics of machine learning and data science is an invaluable skill in today's employment landscape. Moreover, despite their prevalence in logistics and manufacturing, such advanced techniques have yet to see sufficient permeation into industrial R&D, especially in the world of construction materials. The pairing of experience in both of these worlds sets you up excellently for a bright future.

Commitment towards Diversity
We welcome expressions of interest from all eligible applicants. The Construction Industry and the Sika salesforce remain disproportionately under-represented by women and we therefore particularly welcome applications from women interested in a sales career in the building supplies and materials industry. Accordingly, we aim to provide an enabling and inclusive working environment for all.
We Need Your Skills
What we need from you?
You must be pursuing an undergraduate degree in a field strongly linked to chemistry or process engineering
A strong willingness to learn about completely new, and perhaps unintuitive subjects
Mathematical fluency - a minimum of A-Level is preferred
Excellence in the presentation of complex topics and data to non-expert audiences
No prior coding skills are required, but they are appreciated
Good knowledge of standard laboratory practices, safety and etiquette

About the role.
The role centres around the investigation of cutting-edge data science techniques to drive operational efficiency and sustainability initiatives in the manufacture of cementitious products. As part of the R&D network, you will be instrumental in ensuring Sika's trajectory towards becoming the standout low-emissions, high-efficiency supplier of cement-based systems.

Purpose of the Role
The R&D/Data Science student internship has been running for a number of years and has become a critical component of our operations. Students split their time between leveraging data science techniques in order to improve our understanding of industrial raw materials and streamline our portfolio and processes, and working in the laboratory to test their predictions, improving old products, and even designing new ones.
What’s In it for You?
The Opportunity:
Actively pursue an understanding of data science techniques and how they can be utilised in chemical and industrial processes
Spend time working in a research environment, developing a strong knowledge of how different ingredients affect the properties of final products, and the interplay between them
Ideate with a focus on how we can aid in the solution of complex problems using data science, machine learning or AI
Design testing protocols and scrupulously adhere to them, ensuring that your data collection is consistent and complete
The Rewards:
You will be rewarded with a competitive salary, and a sweep of great benefits. We pride ourselves on our total reward package:
Holiday 25 days rising to 28 days with service, plus bank holidays
Hybrid Working

Staff discount platform & Cycle to Work scheme
Dedicated Service Awards for reaching key milestones
Selected discounted Sika products
The Support:
You will join the data science unit of Sika UK, which is nestled inside the greater R&D team. Your primary mentorship and supervisor will come from the members of the Data Science unit, but the R&D team will be constantly present, teaching you laboratory techniques and ensuring the social aspect of your hybrid working experience is not lost. The manager of R&D will be your senior line manager. Sika R&D operates under a no doors policy, meaning we are always available to talk.

The Skills:
Joining the R&D / DS team will give you an insight into the different worlds of industrial research, operational logistics and data science. You will come away with a multitude of new skills, in areas including data manipulation; the fundamentals of machine learning; knowledge of cementitious chemistry; understanding of standards and safe manufacturing processes, not to mention significant experience in laboratory and digital work. Each intern has been a success story, boasting achievements from designing new product lines to finding new raw materials that could revolutionise national industry. A significant commitment to professional and personal development from day one.

The Future:
The possession of deep knowledge in the topics of machine learning and data science is an invaluable skill in today's employment landscape. Moreover, despite their prevalence in logistics and manufacturing, such advanced techniques have yet to see sufficient permeation into industrial R&D, especially in the world of construction materials. The pairing of experience in both of these worlds sets you up excellently for a bright future.

Commitment towards Diversity
We welcome expressions of interest from all eligible applicants. The Construction Industry and the Sika salesforce remain disproportionately under-represented by women and we therefore particularly welcome applications from women interested in a sales career in the building supplies and materials industry. Accordingly, we aim to provide an enabling and inclusive working environment for all.
We Need Your Skills
What we need from you?
You must be pursuing an undergraduate degree in a field strongly linked to chemistry or process engineering
A strong willingness to learn about completely new, and perhaps unintuitive subjects
Mathematical fluency - a minimum of A-Level is preferred
Excellence in the presentation of complex topics and data to non-expert audiences
No prior coding skills are required, but they are appreciated
Good knowledge of standard laboratory practices, safety and etiquette

Innovation Development Lead - AI/Machine Learning (FinTech)
Southampton OR UK Remote
Up to 110k+ 10% Bonus + Share Options

Please note, my client cannot offer VISA Sponsorship for this position.

Your new company
I've been engaged exclusively to recruit a new product team for a global business that specialise in cloud-based technology solutions for financial services customers. They are insistent on working at the sharp edge of technology and will be hiring 20 roles into the team in the coming months. We are currently looking for an AI/Machine Learning Development Lead to drive their innovation strategy forward.

You can be based in their Central Southampton offices (or another UK hub) with hybrid working or can be fully remote in the UK.

Your new role
This role has been created to add depth and expertise to their AI/Machine Learning offering. Currently there is a Director of Innovation and a number of Innovation Engineers. This role sits in between those levels, helping to implement their innovation strategy and creating use cases for AI/Machine Learning technology in the business. There will be an element of hands-on, so you'll still keep sharp on the technical side, and this will be coupled with client facing responsibilities, essentially reinforcing why certain technical choices were made for the customer.

You will also be a crucial liaison to the Product Directors in the team, linking the initial blueprint to the actual build and implementation. In adding depth and a Senior/Lead layer to the innovation team you will help to realise the companies long term visions. This is not a people management role.

As part of the long-term architecture roadmap the intention is to progress their microservice builds to Distributed Ledger Technology on Blockchain (they've already built and run a successful Blockchain which has processed over 250 million transactions) and have been nominated for an award for best use of ML & AI in Finance for a successful chatbot they built for a wealth management client.

What you'll need to succeed
We're looking for an existing Lead Developer/Engineer with AI/Machine Learning experience and solid experience in the Financial Services markets.

You will very likely have a degree in ML/AI or a similar discipline involving emerging technologies and will have exposure to a number of Machine Learning frameworks. We would expect solid experience in cloud/agile environments and you should have knowledge of Python, Matlab, R, C, Java or similar which lend well to these projects.

They use Hyperledger Fabric for DLT. It would be great to see commercial examples where you've built or led
chatbot or ML/AI projects and can show evidence of processing data to facilitate efficient ML.

What you'll get in return
Working here you'll have excellent flexibility and financial rewards. They are flexible on salary and offer a 10% bonus scheme, excellent share options, 6% pension, private healthcare, 4x life and critical illness cover and flexible benefits to opt into specific perks you might want such as dental cover.

There is also an unlimited holiday policy, flexible working hours and an employee-led remote working approach. What's more there has always been a push on social events and team building be it virtual or in person, plus they will fund training courses, exams and conferences which will benefit your career development.

What you need to do now
To find out more and to be considered for this position please apply directly, or contact Max Wilcock, Business Director on 0333 010 5724.

At Hays Technology, we are shaping the future of recruitment. The rapid adoption of cloud, which is making customer interfaces more engaging and creating a seamless engagement with businesses, means that from the foundation of your organisation up, software developers are critical to success.

Depending on your team, typically this means that colleagues spend a minimum of between 20% to 60% of their time in the office, which could be over a week, a month or a quarter. However, some colleagues may choose to spend more time in the office over a typical period than their role type requires. We also have a flexible working process where, subject to business needs, all colleagues globally are able to request work patterns to reflect their personal circumstances

We are currently in the early stages of implementing a hybrid working environment, which means that many colleagues spend part of their working hours at home and part in the office, depending on the nature of the role they are in. We’re flexible on how this works and it may continue to change and evolve. Depending on your team, typically this means that colleagues spend a minimum of between 20% to 60% of their time in the office, which could be over a week, a month or a quarter. However, some colleagues may choose to spend more time in the office over a typical period than their role type requires. We also have a flexible working process where, subject to business needs, all colleagues globally are able to request work patterns to reflect their personal circumstances
Please discuss the detail of the working pattern options for the role with the hiring manager.
