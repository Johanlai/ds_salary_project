We're on a mission to drive the global renewable energy revolution, and we need loads more people to help us make our vision a reality.

Octopus buys power directly from wind, solar and hydro sites all over the UK (and soon all over the world). This allows us to supply our customers with green electricity, straight from the source.
We’re looking for an Analyst to support us as we sign contracts to buy power from more and bigger renewable generators. This Analyst will lead on pricing, risk management and performance monitoring. This will all be done with a view to paying a fair price to renewable generators, and delivering green electricity to Octopus customers at the lowest possible cost.

The ideal candidate will have a passion for using data to enable the transition to renewable energy. And will be comfortable with all the moving parts and complexity that come with the energy industry.

We focus on the big problems and give people the autonomy and resources to find innovative solutions.
What you'll do
Create processes to track performance from contracting through to delivery, identifying areas for improvement.
Quantify and categorise risks in Octopus’s renewable energy origination processes.
Improve and maintain pricing tools, taking risks and historical performance into account.
Develop custom pricing proposals that are mutually beneficial to Octopus and renewable generators.
Work with the Forecasting Team to help Improve and maintain models for forecasting wind, solar and hydro generation at the level of the individual site.
Support the development of innovative commercial structures between Octopus's supply business and Octopus Energy GenerationDevelop alerting for generator outages or reduced performance.
Work with other teams at Octopus, including Strategy, Finance, Generation, Business, Hydrogen and many more.
Support Octopus businesses in other countries by sharing experience and best practices.
What you'll need
Passion for renewables and the energy transition.
Desire to explore complex systems and an ability to learn fast.
Ability to communicate complicated concepts in a way that everyone can understand.
Commercial awareness and financial literacy to identify and understand the problems that need solving.
Comprehensive knowledge of data design, data modelling, data management and data visualisation.
Experience with a scripting language (ideally Python).Experience writing complex queries in SQL, analysing large datasets and building reports and dashboards.

Wondering what the salary for this role is? Just ask us! On a call with one of our recruiters it's something we always cover as we genuinely want to match your experience with the correct salary. The reason why we don't advertise is because we honestly have a degree of flexibility and would never want salary to be a reason why someone doesn't apply to Octopus - what's more important to us is finding the right octofit!
Octopus Energy is a unique culture. An organisation where people learn, decide, and build quicker. Where people work with autonomy, alongside a wide range of amazing co-owners, on projects that break new ground. We want your hard work to be rewarded with perks you actually care about! We won best company to work for in 2022, on Glassdoor we were voted 50 best places to work in 2022 and our Group CEO, Greg has recorded a podcast about our culture and how we empower our people.

What skills do I need?
You don’t need any prior work experience and we don’t ask for you to be studying a specific degree, however you may find your area of study lends itself to a particular placement year opportunity. If you’re studying a Mathematics, Statistics or Economics related degree – or have aspects of these in your course, this is a brilliant internship to get you real-world, corporate experience that will provide you with lots of great experience.

Diversity and inclusion is important to us - we’ve designed our recruitment process to be as inclusive and fair as possible.
You can join in the social side of ABI life – our Sports and Social and Health and Wellbeing committees arrange activities outside of work.
Inclusion matters to us
We welcome applications from candidates from all backgrounds and we run our application process a bit differently – we don’t assess based on CV or past experience. We’ll ask application questions which are relevant to the role and the skills we need to ensure our process is fair, inclusive and everyone has equal opportunity to demonstrate their suitability.

We are actively seeking the benefits of having a range of backgrounds and characteristics in our teams. Diverse teams are more inclined to consider novel ideas and challenge each other, enabling them to infer cause and effect and to solve problems better and thereby help us to better achieve our mission.
