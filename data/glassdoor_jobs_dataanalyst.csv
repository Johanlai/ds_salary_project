Create processes to track performance from contracting through to delivery, identifying areas for improvement.

Improve and maintain pricing tools, taking risks and historical performance into account.
Develop custom pricing proposals that are mutually beneficial to Octopus and renewable generators.
Work with the Forecasting Team to help Improve and maintain models for forecasting wind, solar and hydro generation at the level of the individual site.
Support the development of innovative commercial structures between Octopus's supply business and Octopus Energy GenerationDevelop alerting for generator outages or reduced performance.
Work with other teams at Octopus, including Strategy, Finance, Generation, Business, Hydrogen and many more.
Support Octopus businesses in other countries by sharing experience and best practices.
What you'll need
Passion for renewables and the energy transition.
Desire to explore complex systems and an ability to learn fast.
Ability to communicate complicated concepts in a way that everyone can understand.
Commercial awareness and financial literacy to identify and understand the problems that need solving.
Comprehensive knowledge of data design, data modelling, data management and data visualisation.

Where people work with autonomy, alongside a wide range of amazing co-owners, on projects that break new ground. We want your hard work to be rewarded with perks you actually care about!

Who we are
GWI was founded with the knowledge that understanding your audience is really important for business. When you know who you're speaking to and why, you can create content and campaigns that stand out to the people that matter.
Through our global online survey, we gather data on the behaviour and perceptions of consumers across the world. This provides businesses with deep, actionable insights on their audience, revealed from data they trust.
It's been going well, too. Since launching in 2009, we've become one of the UK's fastest growing target audience companies. We're not about to stop growing any time soon. As a business, we're on a mission to re-engineer data-driven marketing, and we're on the lookout for talented people to join us.
Diversity & Inclusion
Imagine if our data came from just one kind of person. We'd get a very nuanced view of the world. And we definitely wouldn't have got off the ground as a business.
Although things certainly aren't perfect, we live in a society where differences are increasingly celebrated – so we'd expect nothing else from our teams. In fact, the GWI office is as diverse as our global data, it's really important to us that it stays that way. This is a place to feel at home, express yourself freely and make your mark.

Hello! Are you a data analyst who loves to work with data to uncover amazing insights on consumer behaviour? We should talk!
Element Human is a tech company that has built incredible new insight tools for the media industry, to help the world's biggest media platforms, agencies and brands understand their audiences more than ever before.

Across TV, online and social, Element Human has developed a multi-method approach to audience analysis that employs facial coding, eye-tracking, implicit association, and brand metrics. Our global client base includes media platforms that are household names, top performing media agencies, and globally successful brands. Our clients test their content - whether TVC's, branded content, social posts, pre-rolls or other - using our all in one dashboard, and use the insight to fine tune campaigns, generate creative ideas, and produce end of campaign reports.
Element Human is an example of the incredible contribution that machine learning and AI can bring to traditional research methods. Our solution makes time-consuming and costly methodologies easy: setup is simple, fieldwork runs automatically, results are processed and delivered straight to our dashboard or via our API, and the whole process is extremely cost efficient.
We're constantly innovating and pushing technology as hard as we can to build the future of ad and content measurement.

Role
We are looking for a Data Analyst to join our growing Research team at Element Human. Our Research team do the following:

Our testing platform measures how people respond to content, and what that means for their attitudes and behaviour. Having this data allows us to unearth incredible insights to share with the media industry:

What emotion delivers best engagement in the US for sustainability brands?
Which social platform holds attention longer amongst older audiences?
Should an ad start with a strong emotion hook, or end with one?

The answers to these questions and more lie in our data - you just need to reveal it. Giddy with excitement? Can't wait to dive in? Then this is the job for you.

Through our global online survey, we gather data on the behaviour and perceptions of consumers across the world. This provides businesses with deep, actionable insights on their audience, revealed from data they trust.
It's been going well, too. Since launching in 2009, we've become one of the UK's fastest growing target audience companies. We're not about to stop growing any time soon. As a business, we're on a mission to re-engineer data-driven marketing, and we're on the lookout for talented people to join us.
Diversity & Inclusion
Imagine if our data came from just one kind of person. We'd get a very nuanced view of the world. And we definitely wouldn't have got off the ground as a business.
Although things certainly aren't perfect, we live in a society where differences are increasingly celebrated – so we'd expect nothing else from our teams. In fact, the GWI office is as diverse as our global data, it's really important to us that it stays that way. This is a place to feel at home, express yourself freely and make your mark.

You will have a great analytical foundation, and we want you to think about how you apply that in the context of Sainsbury’s – getting to know how we operate is key so you can propose and recommend the approach that should be taken to fulfil data analysis.
You will develop & maintain relationships with your stakeholders, championing a collaborative approach to requirements gathering and the formation of compelling analysis. While staying confident in questioning a proposed strategy or approach to analysis.
We move at pace, whilst still delivering high quality, accurate, professional outputs that land the real truths that sit within the data. You will proactively ensure you are always in touch with the ‘Why’ behind every project – understanding the purpose of your analysis, and which decisions the business is looking to inform.
You will take pride in your work, have brilliant attention to detail, and enjoy presenting findings with empathy towards an audience with a limited technical background. Possessing the ability to translate complex concepts into easily digestible stories with data, which in turn inspire action.
You will embrace our values of Owning It, Making it Better and Being Human.
What you need to know and show
A highly numerate background. You may have a degree in mathematics, statistics or another analytical subject, or analytical work experience.
Excellent SQL knowledge is essential. Python, R or EMR experience is helpful but not vital.
Experience using tools to extract data such as SQL (Snowflake), Python, R and Amazon EMR.
A proven history of delivering actionable insight and demonstrable business change through the application of analytics.
An inquisitive mind, with the curiosity to be constantly on the lookout for opportunities and the ability to logically solve problems. Experience of retail and the analytical challenges retail presents is helpful, but not essential.
A passion for high quality data storytelling. We love data and deriving value from it. The key to the value is in being able to build and tell compelling stories based on this data.
Keen to learn and develop. Pro-active about driving your career development and progression.
The ability to partner brilliantly with the business to understand their problems and deliver value, applying commercial acumen and communicating/connecting in a compelling way.
A high level of team contribution – looking for opportunities to provide input and support across the wider analytics community.
In return you will get:
Colleague discount across the multi-brands – Sainsbury’s, Argos, and Habitat
Holiday allowance
Bonus scheme
Pension plan
Private medical insurance
Special offers on gym memberships, restaurants, holidays, retail vouchers and more
Flexible working
Work-life balance is important to us, so we offer our colleagues as much flexibility as possible in line with the needs of their role. We trust them to decide how, where and when they work, combining remote and collaborative working with a flexible approach to hours, giving them plenty of time and space for life outside of work whilst delivering against our business goals.

And deliver great results that make everyone’s working lives that bit easier.

What’s more, you will be a part of the wider project management community with plenty of opportunities to learn and develop your career.

You will help us to keep doing business the right way – keeping innocent one of the Sunday Times Best Places to Work, using our B Corp status to inspire wider change, and reinforcing our culture of staying little as we grow big. At innocent, it’s the relationships and friendships we create while working together, that make us who we are. It’s why we love hybrid working – a mix of connecting in person and remotely. We’re also aware that the world is changing, and we all want and need different things from our work and home lives. So, if you need to walk the dog, go to the gym, or have commitments outside of work, we’re open to talking through flexible working options that work for you and us.
In return for everything you can bring, we can offer you an exciting, challenging role in a fast-growing and dynamic business, with plenty of career opportunities in the UK and across Europe as well as a competitive rewards package.

In an inclusive, agile environment, you will have the space to be curious, to experiment, and to solve real-world challenges. And you will get to see your creations in the hands of millions of people across the UK.
In the Chief Data and Analytics Office, you will stretch the imagination of what the power of data and insights can bring to how we do things. You will help to unlock the value of Sainsbury’s enormous multi-brand, multi-channel data asset in a centralised ‘mini consultancy’ style analytics team that supports wide parts of the business.

You will have a great analytical foundation, and we want you to think about how you apply that in the context of Sainsbury’s – getting to know how we operate is key so you can propose and recommend the approach that should be taken to fulfil data analysis.
You will develop & maintain relationships with your stakeholders, championing a collaborative approach to requirements gathering and the formation of compelling analysis. While staying confident in questioning a proposed strategy or approach to analysis.
We move at pace, whilst still delivering high quality, accurate, professional outputs that land the real truths that sit within the data.

A proven history of delivering actionable insight and demonstrable business change through the application of analytics.
An inquisitive mind, with the curiosity to be constantly on the lookout for opportunities and the ability to logically solve problems. Experience of retail and the analytical challenges retail presents is helpful, but not essential.
A passion for high quality data storytelling. We love data and deriving value from it. The key to the value is in being able to build and tell compelling stories based on this data.
Keen to learn and develop. Pro-active about driving your career development and progression.
The ability to partner brilliantly with the business to understand their problems and deliver value, applying commercial acumen and communicating/connecting in a compelling way.
A high level of team contribution – looking for opportunities to provide input and support across the wider analytics community.
In return you will get:
Colleague discount across the multi-brands – Sainsbury’s, Argos, and Habitat
Holiday allowance
Bonus scheme
Pension plan
Private medical insurance
Special offers on gym memberships, restaurants, holidays, retail vouchers and more
Flexible working

Organisation 544000 - DATA AND STATISTICS DIVISION
Job Posting 13-Jan-2023, 10:33:46 AM

Directorate Overview
The Bank of England is the UK's central bank. Our mission is to deliver monetary and financial stability for the British people.
The Bank of England is a diverse organisation. Each of its 4,000 people are committed to public service and dedicated to promoting the good of the people of the United Kingdom by maintaining monetary and financial stability.
The Data and Statistics Division (DSD), part of the Data and Analytics Transformation (DAT) Directorate, is the division with responsibilities that span production and management of some of the Bank’s core datasets. The directorate more broadly is responsible for aspects of data management and data culture that reach into the working lives of almost all Bank staff. This is a time of significant change as the way we collect and manage data, and compile statistics, evolves in the light of the use of new technology with DAT at the forefront. The change draws on a wide range of skill sets, including: data management; data science; operational work; subject matter expertise in aspects of economics, statistics and banking and insurance supervision; and people and process management. The roles are in the Financial Statistics Group (FSG) whose focus is on the analysis, compilation, and publication of key statistical outputs such as monetary financial institutions’ contribution to the National Accounts, International Banking Statistics, and capital issuance.
Data compiled by FSG are used by the ONS and a variety of international organisations, including the Eurostat, BIS, IMF, and more, and feature in headline UK statistics such as the Gross Domestic Product, Balance of Payments, and UK Trade. FSG has made good progress building skills in data science applications, such as R and Tableau, in order to build new tools to better carry out the work of the group. This experience will contribute to wider divisional and directorate work, including the large project that DSD is undertaking to replace and upgrade its in-house database.
Job description
FSG is seeking proactive and highly motivated individuals to provide analytical input to the processes used to compile, analyse and publish the group’s high profile statistical datasets. Successful candidates will also find opportunities to learn and develop skills in analytical tools such as R (as well as other coding packages/tools) should that interest them. These have been used to deliver tangible benefits for the groups’ production work to date, and further examples are always being sought. Roles in FSG provide a good opportunity for candidates who are interested in working in a live, high profile operational area of the Bank.

We're on a mission to drive the global renewable energy revolution, and we need loads more people to help us make our vision a reality.

Octopus buys power directly from wind, solar and hydro sites all over the UK (and soon all over the world). This allows us to supply our customers with green electricity, straight from the source.
We’re looking for an Analyst to support us as we sign contracts to buy power from more and bigger renewable generators. This Analyst will lead on pricing, risk management and performance monitoring. This will all be done with a view to paying a fair price to renewable generators, and delivering green electricity to Octopus customers at the lowest possible cost.

The Bank values diversity and inclusion – we want to reflect the society we serve better, we want the best people to work for us and we want our workplace to be inclusive. We value all forms of diversity, including but not limited to age, disability, ethnicity, gender, gender identity, race, religion and sexual orientation. One way we support diversity and inclusion is through our staff-run networks, which are summarised here.
We are fully committed to having a diverse and inclusive working environment, and are open to considering how the role might be carried out with flexible working. This role is therefore open to flexible working patterns. (Delete if operationally this may not be feasible)
Where a role can be carried out from home, we are working towards colleagues spending at least half of their time in the office, so that we can all benefit from working together in person, while maintaining the flexibility offered by home working. From 6 June 2022, we expect colleagues to spend a minimum of 40% of their working time in the office per month. Subject to that minimum requirement, individuals and managers should work together to find what works best for them and their team.
We are also committed to making adjustments for candidates and employees where possible, and have partnered with external expert organisations to support us in this. We are a member of the Disability Confident scheme, summarised here, and people who wish to apply under this scheme should check the box in the ‘Candidate Personal Information’ under the ‘Disability Confident Scheme’ section of the application.
We anonymise applications so hiring managers will not be able to see your personal information when reviewing your submission, including your CV. Please fully complete the application form questions as requested, as any incomplete submissions may not be reviewed.
The Bank of England is a distinctive institution and our rewards are one of the things that set us apart. As well as enjoying a competitive salary you will work in a collaborative, inclusive environment, with a subsidised restaurant, flexible working opportunities and plenty of wellbeing initiatives.
This specific role offers a base salary of £41,270 to £48,870 per annum, along with our comprehensive benefits package as follows:
A non-contributory, career average pension giving you a guaranteed retirement benefit of 1/95th of your annual salary for every year worked. There is the option to increase your pension (to 1/50th) or decrease (to 1/120th) in exchange for salary through our flexible benefits programme each year.
A discretionary performance award based on a current award pool.
A 7% benefits allowance with the option to take as salary or purchase a wide range of flexible benefits.
25 days annual leave with option to buy up to 13 additional days through flexible benefits.
Private medical insurance and income protection.
Employment in this role will be subject to National Security Vetting clearance and the passing of additional Bank security checks in accordance with Bank policy from time to time. Further information of vetting and security clearance requirements for the role will be provided to the successful applicant. Further information about how the Bank processes personal data for these purposes, is set out in the Bank’s Privacy Notice at Privacy and the Bank of England | Bank of England.

Support the development of innovative commercial structures between Octopus's supply business and Octopus Energy GenerationDevelop alerting for generator outages or reduced performance.
Work with other teams at Octopus, including Strategy, Finance, Generation, Business, Hydrogen and many more.
Support Octopus businesses in other countries by sharing experience and best practices.

Passion for renewables and the energy transition.
Desire to explore complex systems and an ability to learn fast.
Ability to communicate complicated concepts in a way that everyone can understand.
Commercial awareness and financial literacy to identify and understand the problems that need solving.
Comprehensive knowledge of data design, data modelling, data management and data visualisation.

Octopus Energy is a unique culture. An organisation where people learn, decide, and build quicker. Where people work with autonomy, alongside a wide range of amazing co-owners, on projects that break new ground. We want your hard work to be rewarded with perks you actually care about!

At Royal London, our People Promise is that we will all work somewhere inclusive, responsible, enjoyable and fulfilling.

Together we belong- collaborate – learn and perform.

Our expectation is that colleagues working in hybrid roles will come into the office for 50% of their time, and the rest from home. We want to be as consistent as we can with our approach but we also appreciate some colleagues need adjustments based on personal circumstances. (e.g. to support a disability, or caring responsibility) and / or may wish to formally seek a flexible working pattern in line with our flexible working policy.

We appreciate the world of work continues to evolve and we will continue to listen to our colleagues views on this whilst ensuring our on-going approach is right for our business and customers

What you'll do
Create processes to track performance from contracting through to delivery, identifying areas for improvement.
Quantify and categorise risks in Octopus’s renewable energy origination processes.
Improve and maintain pricing tools, taking risks and historical performance into account.
Develop custom pricing proposals that are mutually beneficial to Octopus and renewable generators.
Work with the Forecasting Team to help Improve and maintain models for forecasting wind, solar and hydro generation at the level of the individual site.
Support the development of innovative commercial structures between Octopus's supply business and Octopus Energy GenerationDevelop alerting for generator outages or reduced performance.
Work with other teams at Octopus, including Strategy, Finance, Generation, Business, Hydrogen and many more.
Support Octopus businesses in other countries by sharing experience and best practices.
What you'll need
Passion for renewables and the energy transition.
Desire to explore complex systems and an ability to learn fast.
Ability to communicate complicated concepts in a way that everyone can understand.
Commercial awareness and financial literacy to identify and understand the problems that need solving.
Comprehensive knowledge of data design, data modelling, data management and data visualisation.
Experience with a scripting language (ideally Python).Experience writing complex queries in SQL, analysing large datasets and building reports and dashboards.

Wondering what the salary for this role is? Just ask us! On a call with one of our recruiters it's something we always cover as we genuinely want to match your experience with the correct salary. The reason why we don't advertise is because we honestly have a degree of flexibility and would never want salary to be a reason why someone doesn't apply to Octopus - what's more important to us is finding the right octofit!
Octopus Energy is a unique culture. An organisation where people learn, decide, and build quicker. Where people work with autonomy, alongside a wide range of amazing co-owners, on projects that break new ground. We want your hard work to be rewarded with perks you actually care about! We won best company to work for in 2022, on Glassdoor we were voted 50 best places to work in 2022 and our Group CEO, Greg has recorded a podcast about our culture and how we empower our people.

We're on a mission to drive the global renewable energy revolution, and we need loads more people to help us make our vision a reality.

Octopus buys power directly from wind, solar and hydro sites all over the UK (and soon all over the world). This allows us to supply our customers with green electricity, straight from the source.

Develop custom pricing proposals that are mutually beneficial to Octopus and renewable generators.
Work with the Forecasting Team to help Improve and maintain models for forecasting wind, solar and hydro generation at the level of the individual site.
Support the development of innovative commercial structures between Octopus's supply business and Octopus Energy GenerationDevelop alerting for generator outages or reduced performance.
Work with other teams at Octopus, including Strategy, Finance, Generation, Business, Hydrogen and many more.
Support Octopus businesses in other countries by sharing experience and best practices.
What you'll need
Passion for renewables and the energy transition.
Desire to explore complex systems and an ability to learn fast.
Ability to communicate complicated concepts in a way that everyone can understand.
Commercial awareness and financial literacy to identify and understand the problems that need solving.
Comprehensive knowledge of data design, data modelling, data management and data visualisation.

Where people work with autonomy, alongside a wide range of amazing co-owners, on projects that break new ground. We want your hard work to be rewarded with perks you actually care about!

We're on a mission to drive the global renewable energy revolution, and we need loads more people to help us make our vision a reality.

Octopus buys power directly from wind, solar and hydro sites all over the UK (and soon all over the world). This allows us to supply our customers with green electricity, straight from the source.
We’re looking for an Analyst to support us as we sign contracts to buy power from more and bigger renewable generators. This Analyst will lead on pricing, risk management and performance monitoring. This will all be done with a view to paying a fair price to renewable generators, and delivering green electricity to Octopus customers at the lowest possible cost.

The ideal candidate will have a passion for using data to enable the transition to renewable energy. And will be comfortable with all the moving parts and complexity that come with the energy industry.

We focus on the big problems and give people the autonomy and resources to find innovative solutions.
What you'll do
Create processes to track performance from contracting through to delivery, identifying areas for improvement.
Quantify and categorise risks in Octopus’s renewable energy origination processes.
Improve and maintain pricing tools, taking risks and historical performance into account.
Develop custom pricing proposals that are mutually beneficial to Octopus and renewable generators.
Work with the Forecasting Team to help Improve and maintain models for forecasting wind, solar and hydro generation at the level of the individual site.
Support the development of innovative commercial structures between Octopus's supply business and Octopus Energy GenerationDevelop alerting for generator outages or reduced performance.
Work with other teams at Octopus, including Strategy, Finance, Generation, Business, Hydrogen and many more.
Support Octopus businesses in other countries by sharing experience and best practices.
What you'll need
Passion for renewables and the energy transition.
Desire to explore complex systems and an ability to learn fast.
Ability to communicate complicated concepts in a way that everyone can understand.
Commercial awareness and financial literacy to identify and understand the problems that need solving.
Comprehensive knowledge of data design, data modelling, data management and data visualisation.
Experience with a scripting language (ideally Python).Experience writing complex queries in SQL, analysing large datasets and building reports and dashboards.
Why else you'll love it here
Wondering what the salary for this role is? Just ask us! On a call with one of our recruiters it's something we always cover as we genuinely want to match your experience with the correct salary. The reason why we don't advertise is because we honestly have a degree of flexibility and would never want salary to be a reason why someone doesn't apply to Octopus - what's more important to us is finding the right octofit!
Octopus Energy is a unique culture. An organisation where people learn, decide, and build quicker. Where people work with autonomy, alongside a wide range of amazing co-owners, on projects that break new ground. We want your hard work to be rewarded with perks you actually care about! We won best company to work for in 2022, on Glassdoor we were voted 50 best places to work in 2022 and our Group CEO, Greg has recorded a podcast about our culture and how we empower our people.

We have great ambitions: to show the world that you can build a successful business that cares about more than just profit, and to leave things better than we find them.

You will help us to keep doing business the right way – keeping innocent one of the Sunday Times Best Places to Work, using our B Corp status to inspire wider change, and reinforcing our culture of staying little as we grow big.
