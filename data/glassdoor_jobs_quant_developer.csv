Delivery is a team sport, and we encourage everyone at Cleo to share their ideas, so you can expect to be involved in product ideation sessions, user research calls, design reviews, retrospectives, ways of working sessions, product demos, OKR reviews.

Here are some examples, big and small, of the kinds of product feature work our engineers have taken part in over the last year:
Building a secured credit card from scratch to help our users improve their credit scores without changing their habits.
Launching our new budget rewind feature to help users understand their pay-cycle and provide them with better analysis of how they got on with their budget.
Adding discount plans and tiering options to our subscriptions so we can experiment with the best pricing for different types of users.
Whichever squad and part of the business you land in, you will ship changes multiple times a day to our hundreds of thousands of active users and seeing your work having a material impact on the financial health of those most in need.
About you
Firstly and most importantly, all of the above sounds exciting to you and you want to make a positive difference in society by improving the financial health of our users worldwide.
You’ve also read our company values and engineering principles which drive our ways of working and help us deliver working software to our users, learn what works and iterate quickly to improve it. You share and embrace these opinions and are passionate about using them to deliver value.
As this is a SE3-SE4 position we’re looking for someone who has strong industry experience of using Ruby on Rails for a minimum of 4 years. If it’s not quite that much, maybe you want to look at our standard Backend role, and if it’s much less you should look at our Graduate role.
What do you get for all your hard work?

A clear progression plan. We want you to keep growing. That means trying new things, leading others, challenging the status quo and owning your impact. Always with our complete support.
Flexibility: We can’t fight for the world’s financial health if we’re not healthy ourselves. We work with everyone to make sure they have the balance they need to do their best work.
Work where you work best. We’re a globally distributed team. If you live in London we have a hybrid approach, we’d love you to spend one day a week or more in our beautiful office. If you’re outside of London, we’ll encourage you to spend a couple of days with us a few times per year. And we’ll cover your travel costs, naturally.
UK App access: The Cleo app is no longer downloadable in the UK (but only until next year). If you’re an existing user, you’ll still have access to the app. But some features won’t be available (just for a little while). Why? 99% of our users are based in the US–where financial health is often overlooked. We’ve decided to shift our focus to where we can provide the most value and make the greatest impact for users who need it most. Then we’ll be able to apply what we learn to better support our UK users in the future. Check out this page for more information.

You will own the end-to-end analysis and aggregation of data of our global experimentation efforts, working cross-functionally across the organisation to drive evolving maturity in the way we think about, measure and report on individual experiments, and demonstrating how these impact key business metrics.

Mentor associate and mid-level experimentation analysts, acting as their first port of call for triaging experiment analyses and helping them to develop and grow in their own careers.
Collaborate with senior stakeholders across our digital experience teams to identify global business opportunities, where experimentation can accelerate our speed to value realisation.
Identify blockers in our ability to scale, and take a leading role in implementing new processes, tools, technologies, or capabilities to drive programme velocity.
Be accountable for the end-to-end analysis and reporting of global combined experiment outcomes, demonstrating ROI, operational efficiencies, and profit protection.
Act as an ambassador for experimentation across the global organisation, evangelising for its uses, educating others on the benefits of the methodology, and changing hearts and minds to become more data driven.
Report on key individual experiment outcomes, learnings, opportunities, and programme performance across the business, up to c-suite level.
Drive continuous improvement in experimentation & digital data.
Educate and enable individual product teams to better understand their experiment results, hosting training & deep dive sessions to increase organisation-wide experimentation maturity.

Key opportunities for growth in this role:
In this role, you will have the opportunity to develop and grow your data analysis skills in a FTSE100 company with big growth ambitions, with a view to longer term, moving towards either a Principal Experimentation Analyst role, or Experimentation Manager role, depending on whether the individual wishes to build deep specialisms, or move more into people management, strategy, and vision

At Wintermute our mission is to enable, empower and advance the truly decentralized world for more transparent and efficient markets and products.

We do this by providing liquidity algorithmically across most trading venues in crypto, supporting all major centralized and decentralized trading venues, AMMs, RFQs, aggregators and chains. Wintermute is also offering best-in-class OTC products to crypto native as well as traditional financial institutions.

Wintermute is actively participating in the building and development of the blockchain ecosystem through investments from Wintermute Ventures, partnerships and co-development with upcoming protocols and incubation of own projects. We act as official market makers for a large number of the world’s highest profile blockchain projects.

Wintermute is a hyper-growth highly profitable business with a very ambitious vision and roadmap. We manage billions of dollars in assets and trade more than $5B/day. We are backed by Lightspeed, Pantera Capital, Sino Global Capital, Blockchain.com Ventures, Avon Ventures by Fidelity Investments, DeFi Alliance and other top tier investors. We are run as a technology company, not a financial service provider, and we build our culture around core values of ambition, collaboration, entrepreneurship, transparency and meritocracy.

Working at Wintermute

We are looking for a Software Engineer specializing in Python who is passionate about building products/applications that people find useful and enjoy using. At Wintermute you will have an opportunity to grow and make direct impact on trading by developing and improving all the parts of the trading applications, while also getting advice and guidance from very experienced developers and traders, including the founders. You will get a lot of independence and responsibility right away, and you'll learn at an unprecedented speed.

No legacy systems, no corporate bureaucracy, no multiple levels of approvals. It is up to you to make an impact. You will work alongside exceptionally sharp colleagues, learn how to write fail-safe code and improve performance and scalability of GUI and other applications, a real challenge and a rare opportunity!

What will you work on

This role will involve working on QT based Python trading applications. A great advantage of this position is that it is varied, and it is also up to you to shape it in the direction that matches your talents and company needs. Projects may include building a brand-new trading GUI (for internal use), upgrading existing applications, designing a completely application from scratch. We will share more technical details in the interviews.
You will work very closely with traders and trading platform developers. You’ll have an opportunity to improve your knowledge of building high-performance scalable applications, understand broader system architecture and to understand algorithmic crypto currency trading.

We are open to experience from both personal and work-related projects. Interest in algorithmic trading is a plus.
Hard Skills requirements
Advanced knowledge of Python 3
Familiarity with Linux on desktops and servers
Experience building high-performance GUI applications (e.g., the ones working with a very large volume of live data)
Experience implementing client-server systems in Python
Understanding concepts of asynchronous IO
Some familiarity with C++ would be an advantage
Quantitative/reasoning skills
Wintermute Offer
A unique opportunity to work on very interesting projects, get the level of responsibility and ownership that would be unlikely at any other project or trading firm
A unique opportunity to join one of the strongest and most successful technology teams globally
Great company culture: informal, non-hierarchical, ambitious, highly professional yet collaborative and entrepreneurial
A cool office in central London with a sci-fi touch
We support significant flexibility in regards to working from home and working hours; however, we require hard/smart work and >60% work from the office; we are unable to accept remote candidates
Aligned incentive structure: a significant part of your compensation is similar to that of owners - significant performance-based variable pay and the best thing - your contribution directly impacts both and the upside is unlimited
We offer standard perks too, like pension, private health insurance and free food, but that’s probably not the right reason to join us
We offer UK work permits and help in relocation
Write to us if you
Love coding, love problem solving, and love seeing your products work
Love building things
Are curious about algorithmic trading and financial markets
Are determined, ambitious yet humble, willing to work hard and learn on the way
Like meritocracy and being judged by what you deliver
Like working like an owner and not like a 9-to-5 or contractor mentality
Like working in the team environment (not fully remote), at least half-time working from our London office (COVID restrictions allowing)
Tips for a successful application
Only apply to us if you are genuinely interested or curious about this role; this is not for someone who is just looking for ""a job""
Write us a short, honest, and direct message if you'd like to apply. Tell us about why you are interested in GUI/Front End development at Wintermute specifically. Do not send us generic copy paste applications, we are looking for authentic people who share our interests, values and ambitions!
We are able to arrange a UK visa sponsorship for the right candidates

BNP Paribas is a leading bank in Europe with an international reach. It has a presence in 73 countries, with more than 196,000 employees, including around 149,000 in Europe. The Group has key positions in its three main activities: Domestic Markets, International Financial Services (whose retail-banking networks and financial services are covered by Retail Banking & Services) and Corporate & Institutional Banking, which serves two client franchises: corporate clients and institutional investors.
BNP Paribas Corporate and Institutional Banking is a globally recognised leader offering capital markets, securities services, financing, treasury and advisory solutions.
Business Area/Dept Overview
In many respects, banking is the business of managing risks. At BNP Paribas, our well-developed risk management culture is based on a long-term perspective, a committed management, and a strong and independent risk organisation led by RISK. Created at the same time as BNP Paribas, RISK is today a global function present in five continents and at the forefront of risk management through best-in-class expertise.
RISK is an integrated and independent function and is part of BNP Paribas's control functions. It is the independent second line of defence on the risk management activities of the Group which are under its direct responsibilities, including credit and counterparty risk, market risk, funding and liquidity risk, interest rate and foreign exchange risks in the banking book, insurance risk, operational risk and environmental and social risks. RISK aims at being a partner of the businesses by contributing to their sustainable development, but also a gatekeeper to ensure risks taken remain compatible with the Group’s Risk Appetite and its strategy. RISK teams engage in an upstream dialogue with businesses to better understand their strategy, objectives and then they express their opinions and recommendations. RISK Independent Review & Control (RISK IRC) is a special unit within the RISK organisation and reports directly to the Group CRO. The independent review arm of the department provides second line of defence for the use of various types of models and, accordingly, is in charge of model risk management.
Purpose & Scope of role
The position in subject is within the team that covers market risk, counterparty risk and valuation risk methodologies. These methodologies are developed and used globally for both regulatory and internal risk management purposes, covering all activities of the Group. These methodologies cover amongst others:
Market risk internal models like Value-at-Risk (VaR), Stressed VaR, Incremental Risk Capital (IRC) and Comprehensive Risk Measure (CRM) metrics, as well as the new market risk methodologies that are developed to comply with the forthcoming Fundamental Review of the Trading Book (FRTB) regulation. These models cover all asset classes and all products, whether securities or derivatives, including also the market risk management of CVA and funding value adjustment.
On the counterparty risk side, the Group has developed Potential Future Exposure (PFE), Effective Expected Positive Exposure (EEPE) and CVA Capital Charge measures for various OTC, listed derivatives, prime brokerage and repo trading activities. The bank has implemented also the new Standardised Approach for Counterparty Credit Risk (SA-CCR) metric. Furthermore, the Group has developed and uses various types of margining methodologies, like the standard initial margin model (SIMM) used for non-centrally cleared derivatives.
On the valuation risk front, various methodologies are used for fair value and prudent value adjustments. These valuation risk methodologies cover amongst others measures for market price uncertainty, for close-out costs, for model risk, for concentrated positions and for future administrative costs.
Sound model risk management practices require that these market risk, counterparty risk and valuation risk metrics, and any new developments, are subject to various types and levels of independent reviews, assessing the conceptual soundness, the proper application and the limitations of these methodologies. The vision of the team is to use the mean of proactive model risk management in order to enable better decisions where decisions rely on model outputs. We have built a franchise of model risk management services advising senior management, supervisory authorities, as well as serving internal clients requiring model risk assessments for existing or new models.
The position in subject is about the model risk management of the abovementioned types of methodologies, performing independent reviews, assessing model limitations, and advising the stakeholders about the level of model risk born by the use of these methodologies. There is a wide range of activities covered by the team. Therefore, the precise scope of the review activity to be covered by the new team member will depend on the exact skills and experience of the candidate, as well as on the personal development plan that will be set for the team member. There is a key focus in the team on personal development. The team members are currently based in Paris, London, New York, Brussels, Madrid and Montreal. Although they are spread across the globe, they all work as a one team. Roles and responsibilities within the team are location agnostic.
Key Responsibilities of role
The Model Risk Quantitative Analyst position covers the team members who have already gained sufficient model validation experience to be fully autonomous in carrying out model reviews and to coach entry-level team members for the execution of their reviews. Thanks to their experience, analysts can initiate and put through enhancements to the team’s operation. The analyst role includes also team members with more significant professional experiences as long as they work most of the time alone on their review projects autonomously. It is usually proposed that analysts gradually work on various topics to steepen the learning curve.
Model Risk Quantitative Analysts work mostly on independent reviews interacting with the validation managers and with the auditees. The latter usually includes model developers, teams operating the models, and model users. Those stakeholders may be within RISK, within the Business, or within other Group functions.

Experience, Qualifications & Competencies
Required hard skills
Strong quantitative background, owning an MSc or PhD degree in a quantitative subject, preferably a degree in financial mathematics.
This position requires proven professional experience in alignment with the responsibilities.

An Example project for the team:
""We are pricing lots of football leagues, some of which we know nothing about. There is a nice market making algorithm to price them, and reacts to trades in a way that is consistent across various markets (match winner, both teams to score, over/under etc.). I worked on a project to implement this algorithm in a proper way, starting from a ""back of the envelope"" prototype of it.
The work involved reading a mathematical paper about the algorithm, finding problems with the initial implementation and rewriting a large portion it to use faster data structures. Both of us wrote code, studied the theory, and analysed the speed and profitability of the algorithm in production. If an outsider looked at us working together, they wouldn't know who is the quant and who is the engineer.
An interesting part of the project was changing a data structure from dictionary to a Numpy array, which allowed us to change a summation in a nested loop into a single matrix multiplication. This made the code much simpler and faster.""
We are looking for a Quant Developer who will be working on the following key areas for the team:

Theoretical analysis and implementation of both STARKs and SNARKs
Abstract algebra and its applications to cryptography and zero-knowledge
Understanding and designing building blocks in Ethereum, such as Distributed Validator Technology, decentralized identity, and liquid staking, among others
Our team is looking for two kinds of people:
Cryptography enthusiasts who would enjoy analyzing, breaking, and designing cryptographic schemes.
Engineers with some background in cryptography who enjoy making proof of concepts of novel cryptographic protocols, extending cryptographic libraries, and finding vulnerabilities in existing implementations.
A few of the projects Nineveh worked on:
Hybrid proof systems from SNARKs and STARKs. In this project, we combine techniques from SNARKs and STARKs to build hybrid proof systems enjoying the bests of both worlds. SNARKs allow for short (constant-size) proofs and efficient verifiers; on the other hand, they require a trusted setup. zkSTARKs are transparent (don't rely on a trusted setup) and have efficient prover while paying the price of longer proof size (logarithmic to the size of the proven statement) and verifier's complexity. We investigate the use of STARK-related primitives like FRI to give zkSNARKs more efficient provers and reduce security assumptions used. In the near future, we plan to implement our hybrid schemes to reveal the concrete efficiency gains our approach brings.
Secure storage for mnemonic keys. A common problem with using secret keys is that they may be stolen or lost, causing, for example, the loss of access to staked funds. We are building an application that allows users to securely distribute the key into so-called shares. Only a large enough set of shares can be used to reconstruct the secret, and someone who knows too few secret shares learns nothing. We achieve that by using Shamir's secret sharing scheme. Notably, both the secret and the shares are represented by an easy-to-remember mnemonic.
Security analysis of proof systems. In this project, we analyze the security properties of existing zkSNARKs to verify whether they are sufficiently secure for such complex environments as blockchains. To that end, we use provable security methods. Additionally, we analyze existing zkSNARKs and name their security gaps. We show where efficiency-oriented efforts make proof systems unusable due to security vulnerabilities.
Sybil resistant operator onboarding. Liquid staking protocol's efficiency and security relies on operators who take the stake provided by users and run validators for them. Various staking protocols have various operators onboarding procedures. Some require DAO approval, some require the prospective operator to put a significant bond. It is also important that the set of operators is decentralized, and no operator can be a single point of failure or can harm the protocol. Hence, it is of utter importance to make sure that no operator controls more stake than allowed. In this project, we aim to design a Sybil-resistant permissionless operator onboarding mechanism. Here Sybil resistance means that it is difficult for a dishonest party to create and maintain multiple operators to control more than the allowed amount of the stake.
Towards efficient private state contracts. Currently deployed zk-based private-state smart contracts are limited by the fact that they cannot make state transitions that would involve two more more private states. E.g., it is currently infeasible to make a private exchange protocol, as such protocol would require two parties to compute jointly a transformation of their states. To make this possible, secure multi-party computation (MPC) are used. Unfortunately, combining MPC and ZKP naively, results in a protocols which efficiency is dubious. In this project we aim to find a novel method of combining these two primitives to make the shared state computation as efficient as possible for the widest class of functions.
zkSNARKs for CPUs. Virtually all existing zkSNARKs are defined for relations over finite fields. On the other hand, computers perform operations over rings, more precisely $\mathbb{Z}/2^{64}\mathbb{Z}$. In this project, we aim to propose a new zkSNARK for relations defined over rings to benefit from the possibility of performing operations in a way native to CPUs.
New lookup arguments. Since zkSNARKs are defined over finite fields (bigger than $\mathbb{F}_2$), making arguments about binary relations is relatively inefficient. To improve the efficiency of such operations lookup arguments are used. That is, instead of showing that some binary operation has been performed correctly, the prover shows that the relation's inputs and outputs are in a precomputed table. Unfortunately, most lookup arguments rely on trusted setup, what make them useless for transparent (i.e. trusted setup-less) zkSNARKs. In this project we aim to provide more efficient transparent and non-transparent lookup arguments.

We derive our edge from our capacity to generate Win-Wins – in the broadest sense. Win-Win is our fundamental ethical and strategic principle. By generating Win-Wins, we can create unique solutions that reconcile perspectives that are usually seen as incompatible or opposites, and encompass the best that each side has to offer:
We integrate fixed-income arbitrage with global macro strategies in a novel way.
We invent and develop technology that focuses on the potential of human-machine integration.
We build systems where machines do what they do best, supporting people to do what people do best.
We are creating a collaborative meritocracy: a culture where individual contribution serves both personal and collective goals - and is rewarded accordingly.
We value both ownership thinking AND cooperative team spirit, self-realization AND community.

Job Description

We are seeking a candidate for a Quantitative Macro Researcher position focusing on inflation markets of developed countries. The position is within the Quantitative Macro Research team responsible for developing tools to analyse macro economic developments as well as identify opportunities in fixed income and FX markets.

Your role will include developing discretionary frameworks and quantitative models. You will also conduct thematic and ad-hoc research when necessary.

In addition, you will implement your models within our technology systems as well as visualise research output. You will create processes and tests to ensure robust implementation of the models, data used and processes to run these models. You should be hands on to be able to work with data, implement models and deliver results. You will be consulting with other researchers and interacting with developers on performing the analysis, prototyping a solution and automating research workflow.

We value interest and capabilities, entrepreneurial spirit as much as formal experience. Academic credentials are not a requirement if you can demonstrate your skills and added value. You will be working in a creative, less-structured environment, with a degree of autonomy to implement solutions.

What to Expect from our Interview Process
Our interview process is not a cookie cutter process and changes based on the candidate. In general, you should expect:

- An introductory meeting and an aptitude assessment. The aptitude assessment is not a pass/fail test, and we do the same aptitude assessment for all candidates coming to Symmetry - so it cannot be a test of competency for a certain role. We're trying to understand what you're good at and what you're bad at, to try to form a role around your strengths and weaknesses.

A meeting with a member of the team for an open discussion on your background, experiences and how you may fit into the team.

A meeting with someone technical. We're not looking for everyone to be a software developer, but we do like having technical people meet candidates to see how they approach complex problems, how they can break them down and solve them, and how they learn.

Iteration from there, based on the feedback from the interviews and any further interviews to try to figure out where you'd best fit within Symmetry and what role we can create for you.

At Wintermute, you will be responsible for your own “desk” right from the start. You will have the opportunity to develop your own product (trading algorithms, trading strategies), while also getting advice and guidance from very experienced traders and developers, including the founders/management team. You will get a lot of independence and responsibility right away, and you'll learn at an unprecedented speed! No legacy systems, no corporate bureaucracy, no multiple levels of approvals. It is up to you to make an impact. You will act like an owner and your incentives (incl. equity) will be completely aligned with those of the company!

We will share more technical details in the interviews. The point is: there is no limit set by the company!

Excellent quantitative and analytical skills - we will test!
Programming fundamentals (in any of C++, C#, Java, OOP)

Strong interest and curiosity in blockchain, crypto and DeFi - you like keeping track of major news and developments the crypto world
Other Requirements
Have an owner mentality - you focus on ultimate result (short and long-term P&L for the company), focus on strategically growing the business for the future vs “cashing-in” fast

Determined, ambitious yet humble, willing to work hard and learn on the way
Like meritocracy and being judged by what you deliver

Aligned incentive structure: a significant part of your compensation is performance-based with substantial upside

Prepare to be tested on your Python knowledge. Your knowledge and ability to get things done fast is very important to us
Do your homework on what hft/market making/algo trading is. (Hint: we are not in the business of position taking, directional betting, stock/token picking, technical analysis, ""AI"" (as in the buzz-word) and we are not a research business for the sake of research)
We get a lot of applications, so unfortunately, we won't be able to proceed if you simply press ""submit button""; we do promise to reply to everyone who puts time and effort into making the application relevant!

At Wintermute our mission is to enable, empower and advance the truly decentralized world for more transparent and efficient markets and products.

We do this by providing liquidity algorithmically across most trading venues in crypto, supporting all major centralized and decentralized trading venues, AMMs, RFQs, aggregators and chains. Wintermute is also offering best-in-class OTC products to crypto native as well as traditional financial institutions.

Wintermute is actively participating in the building and development of the blockchain ecosystem through investments from Wintermute Ventures, partnerships and co-development with upcoming protocols and incubation of own projects. We act as official market makers for a large number of the world’s highest profile blockchain projects.

Wintermute is a hyper-growth highly profitable business with a very ambitious vision and roadmap. We manage billions of dollars in assets and trade more than $5B/day. We are backed by Lightspeed, Pantera Capital, Sino Global Capital, Blockchain.com Ventures, Avon Ventures by Fidelity Investments, DeFi Alliance and other top tier investors. We are run as a technology company, not a financial service provider, and we build our culture around core values of ambition, collaboration, entrepreneurship, transparency and meritocracy.

Working at Wintermute

We are looking for an Options Trader with 2+ years of experience in an option MM role, strong coding skills (Python) and a curiosity about HFT, market making and crypto trading. We run a lean, flat-hierarchy option trading team, competing successfully against teams many times our size. You will be able to contribute to all aspects of the trading setup while also getting advice and guidance from very experienced traders and developers, including the founders/ management team. You will get a lot of independence and responsibility right away, and you'll learn at an unprecedented speed! No legacy systems, no corporate bureaucracy, no multiple levels of approvals. It is up to you to make an impact.

What will you work on

You will have the chance to work on the full options stack - from valuation/ fitting to systematic market making to discretionary position taking. You will have the chance to expand the options business across all three of cefi, defi, and OTC. We will share more technical details in the interviews. The point is: there is no limit set by the company!

Note: we are looking for people with strong quantitative and coding skills, but this is a trading (not a research) role first and foremost.
Hard Skills Requirements
2+ years of experience trading in an options market making role.
Strong Python skills - ideally 1-3 years of experience coding in Python, be that through work, study or personal project experience
Excellent quantitative and analytical skills
Crypto experience is a plus. However, we are open to applicants with knowledge of other asset classes.
Other Requirements
Have an owner mentality - you focus on ultimate result (short and long-term P&L for the company), focus on strategically growing the business for the future vs fast/opportunistic profits
Love problem solving, and love seeing your products work; you do whatever it takes to do what’s needed (trading, coding, analysing data, collaborating)
Determined, ambitious yet humble, willing to work hard and learn on the way
Like meritocracy and being judged by what you deliver
Have an entrepreneurial mindset versus working 9-to-5 mentality; prepared to work non-standard working hours (since we are a high-growth startup operating in 24/7 crypto world)
Like working in the team environment (not fully remote), at least 75% working from our London office
Wintermute Offer
A unique opportunity to work on very interesting projects, get the level of responsibility and ownership that would take 5-10 years to get in a traditional trading company/bank/hedge fund
A unique opportunity to join a high growth startup and one of the strongest and highest potential crypto startups based in Europe
Great culture: highly professional and ambitious, yet informal, non-hierarchical, collaborative and entrepreneurial
A cool office in central London with a sci-fi touch
Aligned incentive structure: a significant part of your compensation is performance-based with substantial upside
Tips for Successful Application
Only apply to us if you are genuinely interested or curious about this role and the space; this is not for someone who is just looking for ""a job"" or is very mercenary
Do your research: look at our website and social media channels
Write us a short, honest, and direct message if you'd like to apply. Tell us about why you are interested in crypto and market making in general and in Wintermute in particular.
Do not send us generic copy paste applications, we are looking for authentic people who share our interests, values and ambitions! If you don't have some obviously matching experience or skills, make sure you state very clearly what you can bring or how your experience is relevant/transferable (but note, we do require Python knowledge)
Prepare to be tested on your Python knowledge. Your knowledge and ability to get things done fast is very important to us
Do your homework on what hft/market making/algo trading is. (Hint: we are not in the business of position taking, directional betting, stock/token picking, technical analysis, ""AI"" (as in the buzz-word) and we are not a research business for the sake of research)
We get a lot of applications, so unfortunately, we won't be able to proceed if you simply press ""submit button""; we do promise to reply to everyone who puts time and effort into making the application relevant!

3.4",Options Trader,"London, England",-1,-1,1 to 50 Employees,-1,Company - Private,-1,-1,Unknown / Non-Applicable,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,"About Wintermute

At Wintermute our mission is to enable, empower and advance the truly decentralized world for more transparent and efficient markets and products.

We do this by providing liquidity algorithmically across most trading venues in crypto, supporting all major centralized and decentralized trading venues, AMMs, RFQs, aggregators and chains. Wintermute is also offering best-in-class OTC products to crypto native as well as traditional financial institutions.

Wintermute is actively participating in the building and development of the blockchain ecosystem through investments from Wintermute Ventures, partnerships and co-development with upcoming protocols and incubation of own projects. We act as official market makers for a large number of the world’s highest profile blockchain projects.

Wintermute is a hyper-growth highly profitable business with a very ambitious vision and roadmap. We manage billions of dollars in assets and trade more than $5B/day. We are backed by Lightspeed, Pantera Capital, Sino Global Capital, Blockchain.com Ventures, Avon Ventures by Fidelity Investments, DeFi Alliance and other top tier investors. We are run as a technology company, not a financial service provider, and we build our culture around core values of ambition, collaboration, entrepreneurship, transparency and meritocracy.

Working at Wintermute

We are looking for an Options Trader with 2+ years of experience in an option MM role, strong coding skills (Python) and a curiosity about HFT, market making and crypto trading. We run a lean, flat-hierarchy option trading team, competing successfully against teams many times our size. You will be able to contribute to all aspects of the trading setup while also getting advice and guidance from very experienced traders and developers, including the founders/ management team. You will get a lot of independence and responsibility right away, and you'll learn at an unprecedented speed! No legacy systems, no corporate bureaucracy, no multiple levels of approvals. It is up to you to make an impact.

What will you work on

You will have the chance to work on the full options stack - from valuation/ fitting to systematic market making to discretionary position taking. You will have the chance to expand the options business across all three of cefi, defi, and OTC. We will share more technical details in the interviews. The point is: there is no limit set by the company!

Note: we are looking for people with strong quantitative and coding skills, but this is a trading (not a research) role first and foremost.
Hard Skills Requirements
2+ years of experience trading in an options market making role.
Strong Python skills - ideally 1-3 years of experience coding in Python, be that through work, study or personal project experience
Excellent quantitative and analytical skills
Crypto experience is a plus. However, we are open to applicants with knowledge of other asset classes.
Other Requirements
Have an owner mentality - you focus on ultimate result (short and long-term P&L for the company), focus on strategically growing the business for the future vs fast/opportunistic profits
Love problem solving, and love seeing your products work; you do whatever it takes to do what’s needed (trading, coding, analysing data, collaborating)
Determined, ambitious yet humble, willing to work hard and learn on the way
Like meritocracy and being judged by what you deliver
Have an entrepreneurial mindset versus working 9-to-5 mentality; prepared to work non-standard working hours (since we are a high-growth startup operating in 24/7 crypto world)
Like working in the team environment (not fully remote), at least 75% working from our London office
Wintermute Offer
A unique opportunity to work on very interesting projects, get the level of responsibility and ownership that would take 5-10 years to get in a traditional trading company/bank/hedge fund
A unique opportunity to join a high growth startup and one of the strongest and highest potential crypto startups based in Europe
Great culture: highly professional and ambitious, yet informal, non-hierarchical, collaborative and entrepreneurial
A cool office in central London with a sci-fi touch
Aligned incentive structure: a significant part of your compensation is performance-based with substantial upside
Tips for Successful Application
Only apply to us if you are genuinely interested or curious about this role and the space; this is not for someone who is just looking for ""a job"" or is very mercenary
Do your research: look at our website and social media channels
Write us a short, honest, and direct message if you'd like to apply. Tell us about why you are interested in crypto and market making in general and in Wintermute in particular.
Do not send us generic copy paste applications, we are looking for authentic people who share our interests, values and ambitions!

Wintermute is actively participating in the building and development of the blockchain ecosystem through investments from Wintermute Ventures, partnerships and co-development with upcoming protocols and incubation of own projects. We act as official market makers for a large number of the world’s highest profile blockchain projects.

Wintermute is a hyper-growth highly profitable business with a very ambitious vision and roadmap. We manage billions of dollars in assets and trade more than $5B/day. We are backed by Lightspeed, Pantera Capital, Sino Global Capital, Blockchain.com Ventures, Avon Ventures by Fidelity Investments, DeFi Alliance and other top tier investors. We are run as a technology company, not a financial service provider, and we build our culture around core values of ambition, collaboration, entrepreneurship, transparency and meritocracy.

Working at Wintermute
We are looking for a C++ Trading Platform Developer who is passionate about technology, interested in both low level details of how computer hardware operates and high-level design of large systems, as well as in data infrastructure. Someone who likes opening the hood to see how things work, has understanding of data structures, experience writing client-server network applications, and writing and optimising code for high performance. We welcome your previous experience from your own personal projects as well as commercial experience. We are looking for people who are passionate about technology and have experience looking under the hood to see how C++ standard libraries and other solutions are implemented. Interest in algorithmic and quantitative trading is a plus.
At Wintermute you will have an opportunity to grow and make direct impact on trading by developing and improving all the parts of the trading platform, data infrastructure and related software, while also getting advice and guidance from very experienced developers and traders, including the founders. You will get a lot of independence and responsibility right away, and you'll learn at an unprecedented speed! No legacy systems, no multiple levels of approvals, no bureaucracy; all developers report directly to CTO who is very hands on. You are judged by what you deliver, not by the hours your do.
It is up to you to make an impact! You will work alongside exceptionally sharp colleagues, learn how to write fail-safe code and improve performance and scalability of the trading system, a real challenge and a rare opportunity! We have flexible working arrangements, it’s the productivity that matters. At least several days a week in the office with our own gym, unlimited food and drinks are required.
What will you work on
A great advantage of this position is that it is varied, and it is also up to you to shape it in the direction that matches your talents and company needs. The focus of the role would be to work on the global trading platform that spans across many continents, with real time data capture, order entry on dozens of exchanges, robust connectivity and built in monitoring. You would be working on expanding and scaling up our trading platform, mainly using C++ and Python.
All the workstations and servers are running Linux, no windows in trading and the development team. We also keep things simple and easy to understand wherever possible which means designing, scalable and robust C++ and Python code is a main skill. We will share more technical details in the interviews. You will have opportunity to improve your knowledge of software optimisations, of building robust large-scale systems and to understand crypto currency trading.
Hard Skills requirements
Strong C++ skills are required - we will test
Experience with looking under the hood to see how C++ standard libraries work - we will test
Strong analytical skills - we will test
Understanding of networking, CPU and memory model, assembly language - desirable

Great company culture: informal, non-hierarchical, ambitious, highly professional yet collaborative and entrepreneurial
A cool office in central London with a sci-fi touch
Although we are unable to accept fully remote candidates, we support significant flexibility in regards to working from home and working hours.
Weekly team events, such as team lunches, team dinners, team board games and Dota playing sessions; these are not obligatory in any sense, but this is what we like to do
On top of competitive base pay, we offer substantial performance based bonuses
We offer standard perks too, like pension, private health insurance and free food, but that’s probably not the right reason to join us

Collaborate with senior stakeholders across our digital experience teams to identify global business opportunities, where experimentation can accelerate our speed to value realisation.
Identify blockers in our ability to scale, and take a leading role in implementing new processes, tools, technologies, or capabilities to drive programme velocity.
Be accountable for the end-to-end analysis and reporting of global combined experiment outcomes, demonstrating ROI, operational efficiencies, and profit protection.

3.4",Options Trader,"London, England",-1,-1,1 to 50 Employees,-1,Company - Private,-1,-1,Unknown / Non-Applicable,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,"About Wintermute

At Wintermute our mission is to enable, empower and advance the truly decentralized world for more transparent and efficient markets and products.

We do this by providing liquidity algorithmically across most trading venues in crypto, supporting all major centralized and decentralized trading venues, AMMs, RFQs, aggregators and chains. Wintermute is also offering best-in-class OTC products to crypto native as well as traditional financial institutions.

Wintermute is actively participating in the building and development of the blockchain ecosystem through investments from Wintermute Ventures, partnerships and co-development with upcoming protocols and incubation of own projects. We act as official market makers for a large number of the world’s highest profile blockchain projects.

Wintermute is a hyper-growth highly profitable business with a very ambitious vision and roadmap. We manage billions of dollars in assets and trade more than $5B/day. We are backed by Lightspeed, Pantera Capital, Sino Global Capital, Blockchain.com Ventures, Avon Ventures by Fidelity Investments, DeFi Alliance and other top tier investors. We are run as a technology company, not a financial service provider, and we build our culture around core values of ambition, collaboration, entrepreneurship, transparency and meritocracy.

Working at Wintermute

We are looking for an Options Trader with 2+ years of experience in an option MM role, strong coding skills (Python) and a curiosity about HFT, market making and crypto trading. We run a lean, flat-hierarchy option trading team, competing successfully against teams many times our size. You will be able to contribute to all aspects of the trading setup while also getting advice and guidance from very experienced traders and developers, including the founders/ management team. You will get a lot of independence and responsibility right away, and you'll learn at an unprecedented speed! No legacy systems, no corporate bureaucracy, no multiple levels of approvals. It is up to you to make an impact.

What will you work on

You will have the chance to work on the full options stack - from valuation/ fitting to systematic market making to discretionary position taking. You will have the chance to expand the options business across all three of cefi, defi, and OTC. We will share more technical details in the interviews. The point is: there is no limit set by the company!

Note: we are looking for people with strong quantitative and coding skills, but this is a trading (not a research) role first and foremost.
Hard Skills Requirements
2+ years of experience trading in an options market making role.
Strong Python skills - ideally 1-3 years of experience coding in Python, be that through work, study or personal project experience
Excellent quantitative and analytical skills
Crypto experience is a plus. However, we are open to applicants with knowledge of other asset classes.
Other Requirements
Have an owner mentality - you focus on ultimate result (short and long-term P&L for the company), focus on strategically growing the business for the future vs fast/opportunistic profits
Love problem solving, and love seeing your products work; you do whatever it takes to do what’s needed (trading, coding, analysing data, collaborating)
Determined, ambitious yet humble, willing to work hard and learn on the way
Like meritocracy and being judged by what you deliver
Have an entrepreneurial mindset versus working 9-to-5 mentality; prepared to work non-standard working hours (since we are a high-growth startup operating in 24/7 crypto world)
Like working in the team environment (not fully remote), at least 75% working from our London office
Wintermute Offer
A unique opportunity to work on very interesting projects, get the level of responsibility and ownership that would take 5-10 years to get in a traditional trading company/bank/hedge fund
A unique opportunity to join a high growth startup and one of the strongest and highest potential crypto startups based in Europe
Great culture: highly professional and ambitious, yet informal, non-hierarchical, collaborative and entrepreneurial
A cool office in central London with a sci-fi touch
Aligned incentive structure: a significant part of your compensation is performance-based with substantial upside
Tips for Successful Application
Only apply to us if you are genuinely interested or curious about this role and the space; this is not for someone who is just looking for ""a job"" or is very mercenary
Do your research: look at our website and social media channels
Write us a short, honest, and direct message if you'd like to apply. Tell us about why you are interested in crypto and market making in general and in Wintermute in particular.
Do not send us generic copy paste applications, we are looking for authentic people who share our interests, values and ambitions! If you don't have some obviously matching experience or skills, make sure you state very clearly what you can bring or how your experience is relevant/transferable (but note, we do require Python knowledge)
Prepare to be tested on your Python knowledge. Your knowledge and ability to get things done fast is very important to us
Do your homework on what hft/market making/algo trading is. (Hint: we are not in the business of position taking, directional betting, stock/token picking, technical analysis, ""AI"" (as in the buzz-word) and we are not a research business for the sake of research)
We get a lot of applications, so unfortunately, we won't be able to proceed if you simply press ""submit button""; we do promise to reply to everyone who puts time and effort into making the application relevant!

About Nesta
We are Nesta, the UK’s innovation agency for social good. We design, test and scale solutions to society’s biggest problems. Our three missions are to give every child a fair start, help people live healthy lives, and create a sustainable future where the economy works for both people and the planet.
For over 20 years, we have worked to support, encourage and inspire innovation. We work in three roles: as an innovation partner working with frontline organisations to design and test new solutions, as a venture builder supporting new and early stage businesses, and as a system shaper creating the conditions for innovation.
Harnessing the rigour of science and the creativity of design, we work relentlessly to change millions of lives for the better. Find out more at nesta.org.uk
Overview
Nesta’s 2030 strategy articulates our ambition to significantly improve the lives of millions of people by pursuing three innovation missions. We want people in the UK to have a Fairer Start in life, to live a Healthy Life , and to have a Sustainable Future . Our focus is squarely on furthering these three missions, and we have specific goals for each that guide our work.
We believe in the power of data to effect change. We see immense potential to push the boundaries of how data is used in public services and social movements - such as identifying problems earlier using predictive analytics, matching resources with needs more accurately, tailoring services in highly personalised ways, or combining human and machine intelligence at scale.
The Director of Data Analytics will lead Nesta’s Data Analytics Practice (DAP), an interdisciplinary team of data scientists, data engineers, data visualisation and product developers. Nesta’s Practices , teams of experts in different disciplines, work closely with mission teams (teams of experts on each issue) and others around the organisation, to advance Nesta’s missions. Some DAP members are embedded in mission teams.
DAP also works closely with the Behavioural Insights Team ( BIT ), an operationally independent research consultancy owned by Nesta, on projects that pursue social impact through work with clients in the public, private and third sectors in the UK and internationally. The Director of Data Analytics will oversee both Nesta’s Data Analytics Practice and BIT’s Head of Data Science and their reports. Overall, the Director will oversee approximately 30 staff across Nesta and BIT.
For Nesta, the Director will ensure that our data analytics capabilities are used intelligently and efficiently with maximum impact on our missions. This will require close coordination with other teams and disciplines, including both being responsive to colleagues’ interests and priorities and helping colleagues understand the full potential of and use cases for data analytics. They will also be responsible for developing the team’s technical expertise and for building and maintaining the necessary technical infrastructure and processes to maximise team efficiency and efficacy.
To help maintain cutting-edge capabilities in a rapidly evolving field, DAP also undertakes externally-funded work that is broader in focus than our three missions but allows us to build and maintain a stronger team. The Director oversees business development in line with agreed priorities, ensuring projects pursued contribute sufficient income and contribute to organisational goals, for example through the development of new methods that can be applied to our missions.
For BIT, the Director will support BIT’s Head of Data Science in embedding data science in BIT’s day-to-day work and developing BIT’s capabilities in data science skills, including by supporting resource sharing, knowledge exchange, and joint skills development across the two organisations. The Director will also support BIT’s Head of Data Science in business development and in identifying and securing exciting new opportunities to apply data science in the context of behavioural science research.
Over time we expect Nesta’s Practices and BIT’s teams of technical experts to increasingly work closely together. This will enable both organisations to access cutting-edge expertise that can further their impact goals, and will enable methodological experts in both organisations to deploy and develop their skills on a range of projects in not-for-profit and commercial settings that achieve real social impact. Under the supervision of the incoming Chief Analyst (a new role overseeing Nesta’s and BIT’s technical teams), the Director will work to bring this vision to life.
The Role
The role has three main components. First, setting strategy and direction. Second, being a technical expert who delivers and helps others deliver high quality work. Third, providing organisational leadership and managing people day-to-day.
Strategy / Direction Ensure that DAP has a clear, widely-understood and widely bought-into articulation of its role and priorities over the next 2-3 years. This will build on the strategy work conducted prior to the Director’s appointment (draft ‘DAP strategy’) Bring that strategy to life through effective team leadership, resource allocation and prioritisation - problem-solving as needed and managing any issues that emerge Work with BIT’s Head of Data Science to ensure BIT’s data science capabilities are effectively deployed to further BIT’s impact and commercial goals on an ongoing basis Identify the similarities and differences between BIT’s and Nesta’s data analytics / data science needs and ensure any relevant synergies are made use of to both organisations’ mutual gain Ensure a strong impact ‘return’ on Nesta’s and BIT’s investments in these capabilities Oversee business development and fundraising for DAP. Maximise the quality, financial contribution and relevance of opportunities pursued and the efficiency of business development and delivery activities. Ensure team focus remains clear and directed at organisational priorities
Technical Work / Delivery Identify and articulate opportunities for self and team to take on ambitious data analytics projects/programmes that make a big difference to Nesta’s missions and BIT’s goals. Work closely with colleagues in other Nesta teams and BIT to develop and prioritise among opportunities Identify and pursue a technical vision for developing the practice of data analytics at Nesta (what capabilities we want to build over time, where we want to push boundaries, and how that can make a real difference to our missions) that fits within our resourcing bounds Stay abreast of the latest techniques and methodological developments in the field, providing technical guidance and inspiration to team members Oversee the team’s technical and programme management infrastructure Actively participate in project/programme design Establish and where necessary conduct appropriate quality assurance of team outputs and processes Help build team credibility internally and externally, including (where relevant to team and organisational priorities): Building relationships with leading academic institutions and technical communities Exploring opportunities to disseminate team outputs through leading conferences and journals Promoting and disseminating the work of the Practice internally and externally, including ‘packaging’ the work for non-technical audiences
Management / Leadership Collaboration - ensure teams are working well with colleagues. E.g. for DAP this means working closely with mission teams, other Practices and BIT. Identify blockers to collaboration and help identify and implement solutions Staff engagement - ensure team members are engaged and productive, and identify and deliver changes as needed to ensure high staff engagement (as measured by periodic org-wide surveys) Organisational leadership - act as a bridge between the priorities of the Chief Analyst and the work of the teams the Director oversees. Positively represent org-wide priorities and deal with or escalate concerns as needed Take a proactive approach to organisational growth and change, ensuring DAP’s position and role in the organisation continues to adapt and be well-understood by other leaders. Lead the team through periods of change when needed and create the conditions for the longer-term stability and clarity of role that will allow the team to thrive Oversee and manage DAP’s budget, with the support of the Senior Programme Manager Line manage data engineering, programme management and product development leads, and data science leads Lead by example on quality standards and ethics and help other team members to do the same Participate actively in Nesta’s leadership group (Directors and Heads) through periodic Leadership Breakfasts, Strategy Progress Reviews, etc., and engage positively with organisation-wide change initiatives and priorities (e.g. development of the ‘Nesta Way’, a cross-Nesta articulation of how we aspire to address knotty social challenges using the tools at our disposal)
The Person
Qualifications / Experience PhD or equivalent professional experience in relevant discipline (Computer Science, Machine Learning, Computational Social Science, Quantitative Economics) At least 5 years’ experience managing interdisciplinary data science teams and a strong track record of organisational leadership Hands-on experience with key data science tools, techniques and development processes including Python and its data science stack, machine learning methods and GitHub Track record of securing and delivering high impact applied data science projects Strong publication track record Interest in other disciplines that can be combined with data analytics in order to deliver high impact projects, particularly those represented at Nesta and BIT (behavioural science, design & technology, collective intelligence, the arts) Strong networks with relevant technical, policy and academic communities Ideally, domain knowledge of one or more of Nesta’s mission areas
Skills / Mindsets Intrinsically motivated by Nesta’s missions with a strong desire to put the power of data science to work to further them, and to work with pace and purpose to achieve shared goals A demonstrated leader with an understanding and acceptance of complex organisational dynamics and an ability to lead teams effectively within that context A general desire to find direct and efficient solutions to given problems, identifying the right degree of rigour for the problem/need being addressed, and delivering accordingly A solid grounding in statistics to complement other technical skills A comfort working within and across not-for-profit and for-profit contexts while pursuing impact goals A comfort running with problems or solutions that originated elsewhere if they are the best path to shared goals A strong manager, with repeated experience leading people to be highly engaged, productive and content in their roles A rigorous, collaborative, flexible and pragmatic attitude Excellent organisational, presentation and writing skills

Who we are
JNCTION is a market leading scale-up business based in London working on a range of innovative digital applications and projects within the rail industry.
The UK rail industry is undergoing the largest transformation seen in a generation and at JNCTION we are positioning ourselves to be at the centre of this change.
As we enter a phase of rapid commercialisation and growth, we are now seeking a Back-end or Full-stack Developer to help lead and deliver a variety of leading-edge software technology and data-led projects.

What you will be doing
You will be working on a wide variety of JNCTION’s data, software and consulting projects, using your software engineering experience to help deliver solutions to improve rail in the UK. One example of the tools you may be working on includes our Decision Support Tool, currently used by the train operator LNER to help minimise delays to passengers during times of disruption.
You’ll be expected to work with a wide variety of programming languages and platforms at JNCTION, due to the varying nature of our clients’ development environments. However, our current projects generally include the use of the following:
Node.js (TypeScript)
ExpressJS/ React
Python
SQL (MariaDB, PostgreSQL)
Microsoft Azure/AWS Cloud
Java
Apache data technologies(Camel, ActiveMQ, Spark, Kafka, Airflow, etc.)
Docker
You’ll also work closely with our Head of Software who will provide direction and technical support in your projects.
JNCTION’s fast-paced, rapid growth environment means you could be expected to take on other roles from time-to-time.

About you
You’ll ideally have at least 1 year’s relevant experience working in a software or data engineering capacity. If this experience is within rail, then even better! But don’t worry if not, an interest in learning the various intricacies of the rail industry and its data is all that’s needed.
You’ll enjoy solving problems and working with ambiguity– we work on a huge variety of problems and therefore can never be certain how one day will pan out!
As a small, but rapidly expanding firm, you’ll need to enjoy working in small teams with a wide range of skills and experience and be excited about the opportunity to help build the company over the coming years, with the potential to grow into a senior leadership role.
You’ll have excellent communication and organisational skills and won’t be afraid to say when you do not understand something and need help – we work closely as a team and are keen to help each other learn.
Finally, you will also need to be fluent in English and hold a valid UK work visa.

Requirements:
We’ve talked through our technology stack and working environments above, but as long as you’re someone who loves to code and learn with proven experience then we’d love to hear from you!
Our only hard requirement is for you to hold a valid UK work visa.

Nice to have:
Experience working in a test-driven environment
Experience developing fault-tolerant real-time services
Experience with modern DevOps technologies (CICD, Terraform, Ansible etc.)
Experience with stream processing frameworks (Spark etc.)
Rail domain experience
Bachelor’s degree in a quantitative field
Experience working with an Agile development methodology

Collaborate with senior stakeholders across our digital experience teams to identify global business opportunities, where experimentation can accelerate our speed to value realisation.
Identify blockers in our ability to scale, and take a leading role in implementing new processes, tools, technologies, or capabilities to drive programme velocity.
Be accountable for the end-to-end analysis and reporting of global combined experiment outcomes, demonstrating ROI, operational efficiencies, and profit protection.
Act as an ambassador for experimentation across the global organisation, evangelising for its uses, educating others on the benefits of the methodology, and changing hearts and minds to become more data driven.
Report on key individual experiment outcomes, learnings, opportunities, and programme performance across the business, up to c-suite level.
Drive continuous improvement in experimentation & digital data.
Educate and enable individual product teams to better understand their experiment results, hosting training & deep dive sessions to increase organisation-wide experimentation maturity.

About the Group

The Model Risk Governance and Review Group (MRGR) oversees model risk at the firm, conducts independent model reviews, and provides guidance around a model's appropriate usage. The Group is tasked with assessing and mitigating the risk posed by usage of all types of quantitative models in the firm.

Job summary:

Financial Institutions routinely use models for a broad range of activities including credit underwriting, valuing financial instruments, measuring and managing risk, assessing the adequacy of reserves and capital resources, and many other applications. Model Risk arises from the potential adverse consequences of making decisions based on incorrect or misused model outputs and reports, leading to financial loss, poor business decision making, or reputational damage.

The Group (MRGR) is responsible for conducting model validation to help identify, measure, and mitigate Model Risk. The objective is to ensure that models are used appropriately in the business context and that model users are aware of the models' strengths and limitations and how these can impact their decisions.

The aim of the MRGR VaR group is to perform reviews of the Firm's VaR models and to ensure the way in which JP Morgan quantifies, monitors and manages risk is robust. This role involves examining the behavior of these risk models by examining their performance for different exposures and in varying market conditions. It entails exposure to a broad range of models, including the pricing models used to value derivatives, and statistical models of the risk factors used to estimate possible market scenarios.

MRGR carries out model validation activities and works closely with Risk, Finance and LOB professionals to review findings, and to perform on-going model risk measurement and risk mitigation strategies.

Core responsibilities:

The successful candidate will be a member of MRGR and will work on the validation of VaR models used in connection with regulatory capital measurement. The successful candidate will carry out a number of model validation activities, including:
Model reviews: evaluate conceptual soundness of model specification; reasonableness of assumptions and reliability of inputs; completeness of testing performed to support the correctness of the implementation; robustness of numerical aspects; suitability and comprehensiveness of performance metrics and risk measures associated with use of a model.
Model risk measurement: design and implement experiments to measure the potential impact of model limitations, parameter estimation error or deviations from model assumptions; compare model outputs with empirical evidence and/or outputs from model benchmarks.
Identify market conditions under which a model's performance may degrade.
Liaise with FO, Finance and Risk professionals to monitor usage and performance of the models and syndicate the findings of model validation.
Document and explain review findings to model developers and risk management.

Minimum Skills, Experience and Qualifications

We are looking for someone excited to join our organization. If you meet the minimum requirements below, you are encouraged to apply to be considered for this role.
An advanced degree in a subject such as Applied Mathematics, Economics, Physics, Statistics, Engineering or similar.
Deep understanding of probability theory, econometrics, statistics, and numerical methods.
Experienced in one or more programming languages and in working with complex data sets.
Excellent analytical and problem solving abilities.
Inquisitive nature, ability to ask right questions and to escalate issues. Risk & Control mindset.
Excellent communication skills (written and verbal).

Additional Skills, Experience and Qualifications

The following additional items will be considered but are not required for this role
Model validation, model developer, or trading desk support experience.
J.P. Morgan is a global leader in financial services, providing strategic advice and products to the world's most prominent corporations, governments, wealthy individuals and institutional investors. Our first-class business in a first-class way approach to serving clients drives everything we do. We strive to build trusted, long-term partnerships to help our clients achieve their business objectives.

Every day, we fight for the world’s financial health, building a beloved AI that empowers people to make better financial decisions.
Backed by some of the most well-known investors in tech, we’ve reached over 4 million users and plan to double that number each year...which is where you come in.
We’re looking for a brilliant senior backend Ruby engineer to join us on our mission to fight for the world's financial health. You’ll be joining a team of adaptable, creative and product-focused engineers who ship working software. We understand our customers, we understand their pain, and we are passionate about helping them.

We strongly encourage applications from people of colour, the LGBTQ+ community, people with disabilities, neurodivergent people, parents, carers, and people from lower socio-economic backgrounds. If there’s anything we can do to accommodate your specific situation, please let us know. You can also see our latest DE&I report here.
What you’ll be doing:
Joining a cross-functional product squad with a mix of backend engineers, data analysts, frontend engineers, user researchers, designers, UX writers and others to develop features that improve our users ’financial health.
Collaborating with other leaders in your squad and pillar to provide technical insight into upcoming feature work, and leading the delivery of work by helping pull everyone together to get it shipped.
Mentoring your colleagues to help them become the best engineers they can be. You intentionally take time to share your skills and experiences with them and actively support their growth.
Working on our Ruby on Rails monolith to build out data models, background workers, JSON apis, and business logic services to support those product features.
Delivering your work wrapped in the tools and techniques we use to let us iterate quickly: tests, observability, AB-tests and feature flags.
Analysing data, wherever you might find it—querying our postgresql database, investigating our application logs, monitoring our stats and performance metrics, or digging into our quantitative user research data—to detect problems and come up with new ideas.
Supporting your colleagues by joining our in-hours support rota, and, optionally, joining our compensated out-of-hours on-call rota.
Getting involved in cross-cutting concerns that lift our entire engineering effort with the rest of the backend chapter.
Taking part in shaping all the work your squad does, not just the technical parts. Delivery is a team sport, and we encourage everyone at Cleo to share their ideas, so you can expect to be involved in product ideation sessions, user research calls, design reviews, retrospectives, ways of working sessions, product demos, OKR reviews.

Here are some examples, big and small, of the kinds of product feature work our engineers have taken part in over the last year:
Building a secured credit card from scratch to help our users improve their credit scores without changing their habits.
Launching our new budget rewind feature to help users understand their pay-cycle and provide them with better analysis of how they got on with their budget.
Adding discount plans and tiering options to our subscriptions so we can experiment with the best pricing for different types of users.
Whichever squad and part of the business you land in, you will ship changes multiple times a day to our hundreds of thousands of active users and seeing your work having a material impact on the financial health of those most in need.
About you
Firstly and most importantly, all of the above sounds exciting to you and you want to make a positive difference in society by improving the financial health of our users worldwide.
You’ve also read our company values and engineering principles which drive our ways of working and help us deliver working software to our users, learn what works and iterate quickly to improve it. You share and embrace these opinions and are passionate about using them to deliver value.
As this is a SE3-SE4 position we’re looking for someone who has strong industry experience of using Ruby on Rails for a minimum of 4 years. If it’s not quite that much, maybe you want to look at our standard Backend role, and if it’s much less you should look at our Graduate role.
What do you get for all your hard work?
A competitive compensation package (base + equity) with bi-annual reviews. You can view our public progression framework and salary bandings here: https://cleo-ai.progressionapp.com/engineering- This position is a SE3-SE4 level and we can pay£63,292-£96,792 p.a depending on experience.
Work at one of the fastest-growing tech startups, backed by top VC firms, Balderton & EQT Ventures
A clear progression plan. We want you to keep growing. That means trying new things, leading others, challenging the status quo and owning your impact. Always with our complete support.
Flexibility: We can’t fight for the world’s financial health if we’re not healthy ourselves. We work with everyone to make sure they have the balance they need to do their best work.
Work where you work best. We’re a globally distributed team. If you live in London we have a hybrid approach, we’d love you to spend one day a week or more in our beautiful office. If you’re outside of London, we’ll encourage you to spend a couple of days with us a few times per year. And we’ll cover your travel costs, naturally.
UK App access: The Cleo app is no longer downloadable in the UK (but only until next year). If you’re an existing user, you’ll still have access to the app. But some features won’t be available (just for a little while). Why? 99% of our users are based in the US–where financial health is often overlooked. We’ve decided to shift our focus to where we can provide the most value and make the greatest impact for users who need it most. Then we’ll be able to apply what we learn to better support our UK users in the future. Check out this page for more information.

As this is a SE3-SE4 position we’re looking for someone who has strong industry experience of using Ruby on Rails for a minimum of 4 years. If it’s not quite that much, maybe you want to look at our standard Backend role, and if it’s much less you should look at our Graduate role.
What do you get for all your hard work?
A competitive compensation package (base + equity) with bi-annual reviews. You can view our public progression framework and salary bandings here: https://cleo-ai.progressionapp.com/engineering- This position is a SE3-SE4 level and we can pay£63,292-£96,792 p.a depending on experience.
Work at one of the fastest-growing tech startups, backed by top VC firms, Balderton & EQT Ventures
A clear progression plan. We want you to keep growing. That means trying new things, leading others, challenging the status quo and owning your impact. Always with our complete support.
Flexibility: We can’t fight for the world’s financial health if we’re not healthy ourselves. We work with everyone to make sure they have the balance they need to do their best work.
Work where you work best. We’re a globally distributed team. If you live in London we have a hybrid approach, we’d love you to spend one day a week or more in our beautiful office. If you’re outside of London, we’ll encourage you to spend a couple of days with us a few times per year. And we’ll cover your travel costs, naturally.
UK App access: The Cleo app is no longer downloadable in the UK (but only until next year). If you’re an existing user, you’ll still have access to the app. But some features won’t be available (just for a little while). Why? 99% of our users are based in the US–where financial health is often overlooked. We’ve decided to shift our focus to where we can provide the most value and make the greatest impact for users who need it most. Then we’ll be able to apply what we learn to better support our UK users in the future. Check out this page for more information.

Every day, we fight for the world’s financial health, building a beloved AI that empowers people to make better financial decisions.
Backed by some of the most well-known investors in tech, we’ve reached over 4 million users and plan to double that number each year...which is where you come in.
We’re looking for a brilliant senior backend Ruby engineer to join us on our mission to fight for the world's financial health. You’ll be joining a team of adaptable, creative and product-focused engineers who ship working software. We understand our customers, we understand their pain, and we are passionate about helping them.
View how we run our Engineering Interview process here! https://web.meetcleo.com/blog/how-we-do-engineering-interviews-at-cleo
We strongly encourage applications from people of colour, the LGBTQ+ community, people with disabilities, neurodivergent people, parents, carers, and people from lower socio-economic backgrounds. If there’s anything we can do to accommodate your specific situation, please let us know. You can also see our latest DE&I report here.
What you’ll be doing:
Joining a cross-functional product squad with a mix of backend engineers, data analysts, frontend engineers, user researchers, designers, UX writers and others to develop features that improve our users ’financial health.
Collaborating with other leaders in your squad and pillar to provide technical insight into upcoming feature work, and leading the delivery of work by helping pull everyone together to get it shipped.
Mentoring your colleagues to help them become the best engineers they can be. You intentionally take time to share your skills and experiences with them and actively support their growth.
Working on our Ruby on Rails monolith to build out data models, background workers, JSON apis, and business logic services to support those product features.
Delivering your work wrapped in the tools and techniques we use to let us iterate quickly: tests, observability, AB-tests and feature flags.
Analysing data, wherever you might find it—querying our postgresql database, investigating our application logs, monitoring our stats and performance metrics, or digging into our quantitative user research data—to detect problems and come up with new ideas.
Supporting your colleagues by joining our in-hours support rota, and, optionally, joining our compensated out-of-hours on-call rota.
Getting involved in cross-cutting concerns that lift our entire engineering effort with the rest of the backend chapter.
Taking part in shaping all the work your squad does, not just the technical parts. Delivery is a team sport, and we encourage everyone at Cleo to share their ideas, so you can expect to be involved in product ideation sessions, user research calls, design reviews, retrospectives, ways of working sessions, product demos, OKR reviews.

Here are some examples, big and small, of the kinds of product feature work our engineers have taken part in over the last year:
Building a secured credit card from scratch to help our users improve their credit scores without changing their habits.
Launching our new budget rewind feature to help users understand their pay-cycle and provide them with better analysis of how they got on with their budget.
Adding discount plans and tiering options to our subscriptions so we can experiment with the best pricing for different types of users.
Whichever squad and part of the business you land in, you will ship changes multiple times a day to our hundreds of thousands of active users and seeing your work having a material impact on the financial health of those most in need.
About you
Firstly and most importantly, all of the above sounds exciting to you and you want to make a positive difference in society by improving the financial health of our users worldwide.
You’ve also read our company values and engineering principles which drive our ways of working and help us deliver working software to our users, learn what works and iterate quickly to improve it. You share and embrace these opinions and are passionate about using them to deliver value.
As this is a SE3-SE4 position we’re looking for someone who has strong industry experience of using Ruby on Rails for a minimum of 4 years. If it’s not quite that much, maybe you want to look at our standard Backend role, and if it’s much less you should look at our Graduate role.
What do you get for all your hard work?
A competitive compensation package (base + equity) with bi-annual reviews. You can view our public progression framework and salary bandings here: https://cleo-ai.progressionapp.com/engineering- This position is a SE3-SE4 level and we can pay£63,292-£96,792 p.a depending on experience.
Work at one of the fastest-growing tech startups, backed by top VC firms, Balderton & EQT Ventures
A clear progression plan. We want you to keep growing. That means trying new things, leading others, challenging the status quo and owning your impact. Always with our complete support.
Flexibility: We can’t fight for the world’s financial health if we’re not healthy ourselves. We work with everyone to make sure they have the balance they need to do their best work.
Work where you work best. We’re a globally distributed team. If you live in London we have a hybrid approach, we’d love you to spend one day a week or more in our beautiful office. If you’re outside of London, we’ll encourage you to spend a couple of days with us a few times per year. And we’ll cover your travel costs, naturally.
UK App access: The Cleo app is no longer downloadable in the UK (but only until next year). If you’re an existing user, you’ll still have access to the app. But some features won’t be available (just for a little while). Why? 99% of our users are based in the US–where financial health is often overlooked. We’ve decided to shift our focus to where we can provide the most value and make the greatest impact for users who need it most. Then we’ll be able to apply what we learn to better support our UK users in the future. Check out this page for more information.

Every day, we fight for the world’s financial health, building a beloved AI that empowers people to make better financial decisions.
Backed by some of the most well-known investors in tech, we’ve reached over 4 million users and plan to double that number each year...which is where you come in.
We’re looking for a brilliant senior backend Ruby engineer to join us on our mission to fight for the world's financial health. You’ll be joining a team of adaptable, creative and product-focused engineers who ship working software. We understand our customers, we understand their pain, and we are passionate about helping them.
View how we run our Engineering Interview process here! https://web.meetcleo.com/blog/how-we-do-engineering-interviews-at-cleo
We strongly encourage applications from people of colour, the LGBTQ+ community, people with disabilities, neurodivergent people, parents, carers, and people from lower socio-economic backgrounds. If there’s anything we can do to accommodate your specific situation, please let us know. You can also see our latest DE&I report here.
What you’ll be doing:
Joining a cross-functional product squad with a mix of backend engineers, data analysts, frontend engineers, user researchers, designers, UX writers and others to develop features that improve our users ’financial health.
Collaborating with other leaders in your squad and pillar to provide technical insight into upcoming feature work, and leading the delivery of work by helping pull everyone together to get it shipped.
Mentoring your colleagues to help them become the best engineers they can be. You intentionally take time to share your skills and experiences with them and actively support their growth.
Working on our Ruby on Rails monolith to build out data models, background workers, JSON apis, and business logic services to support those product features.
Delivering your work wrapped in the tools and techniques we use to let us iterate quickly: tests, observability, AB-tests and feature flags.
Analysing data, wherever you might find it—querying our postgresql database, investigating our application logs, monitoring our stats and performance metrics, or digging into our quantitative user research data—to detect problems and come up with new ideas.
Supporting your colleagues by joining our in-hours support rota, and, optionally, joining our compensated out-of-hours on-call rota.
Getting involved in cross-cutting concerns that lift our entire engineering effort with the rest of the backend chapter.
Taking part in shaping all the work your squad does, not just the technical parts. Delivery is a team sport, and we encourage everyone at Cleo to share their ideas, so you can expect to be involved in product ideation sessions, user research calls, design reviews, retrospectives, ways of working sessions, product demos, OKR reviews.

Here are some examples, big and small, of the kinds of product feature work our engineers have taken part in over the last year:
Building a secured credit card from scratch to help our users improve their credit scores without changing their habits.
Launching our new budget rewind feature to help users understand their pay-cycle and provide them with better analysis of how they got on with their budget.
Adding discount plans and tiering options to our subscriptions so we can experiment with the best pricing for different types of users.
Whichever squad and part of the business you land in, you will ship changes multiple times a day to our hundreds of thousands of active users and seeing your work having a material impact on the financial health of those most in need.
About you
Firstly and most importantly, all of the above sounds exciting to you and you want to make a positive difference in society by improving the financial health of our users worldwide.
You’ve also read our company values and engineering principles which drive our ways of working and help us deliver working software to our users, learn what works and iterate quickly to improve it. You share and embrace these opinions and are passionate about using them to deliver value.
As this is a SE3-SE4 position we’re looking for someone who has strong industry experience of using Ruby on Rails for a minimum of 4 years. If it’s not quite that much, maybe you want to look at our standard Backend role, and if it’s much less you should look at our Graduate role.
What do you get for all your hard work?
A competitive compensation package (base + equity) with bi-annual reviews. You can view our public progression framework and salary bandings here: https://cleo-ai.progressionapp.com/engineering- This position is a SE3-SE4 level and we can pay£63,292-£96,792 p.a depending on experience.

A clear progression plan. We want you to keep growing. That means trying new things, leading others, challenging the status quo and owning your impact. Always with our complete support.
Flexibility: We can’t fight for the world’s financial health if we’re not healthy ourselves. We work with everyone to make sure they have the balance they need to do their best work.
Work where you work best. We’re a globally distributed team. If you live in London we have a hybrid approach, we’d love you to spend one day a week or more in our beautiful office. If you’re outside of London, we’ll encourage you to spend a couple of days with us a few times per year. And we’ll cover your travel costs, naturally.
UK App access: The Cleo app is no longer downloadable in the UK (but only until next year). If you’re an existing user, you’ll still have access to the app. But some features won’t be available (just for a little while). Why? 99% of our users are based in the US–where financial health is often overlooked. We’ve decided to shift our focus to where we can provide the most value and make the greatest impact for users who need it most. Then we’ll be able to apply what we learn to better support our UK users in the future. Check out this page for more information.

Every day, we fight for the world’s financial health, building a beloved AI that empowers people to make better financial decisions.
Backed by some of the most well-known investors in tech, we’ve reached over 4 million users and plan to double that number each year...which is where you come in.
We’re looking for a brilliant senior backend Ruby engineer to join us on our mission to fight for the world's financial health. You’ll be joining a team of adaptable, creative and product-focused engineers who ship working software. We understand our customers, we understand their pain, and we are passionate about helping them.
View how we run our Engineering Interview process here! https://web.meetcleo.com/blog/how-we-do-engineering-interviews-at-cleo
We strongly encourage applications from people of colour, the LGBTQ+ community, people with disabilities, neurodivergent people, parents, carers, and people from lower socio-economic backgrounds. If there’s anything we can do to accommodate your specific situation, please let us know. You can also see our latest DE&I report here.
What you’ll be doing:
Joining a cross-functional product squad with a mix of backend engineers, data analysts, frontend engineers, user researchers, designers, UX writers and others to develop features that improve our users ’financial health.
Collaborating with other leaders in your squad and pillar to provide technical insight into upcoming feature work, and leading the delivery of work by helping pull everyone together to get it shipped.
Mentoring your colleagues to help them become the best engineers they can be. You intentionally take time to share your skills and experiences with them and actively support their growth.
Working on our Ruby on Rails monolith to build out data models, background workers, JSON apis, and business logic services to support those product features.
Delivering your work wrapped in the tools and techniques we use to let us iterate quickly: tests, observability, AB-tests and feature flags.
Analysing data, wherever you might find it—querying our postgresql database, investigating our application logs, monitoring our stats and performance metrics, or digging into our quantitative user research data—to detect problems and come up with new ideas.
Supporting your colleagues by joining our in-hours support rota, and, optionally, joining our compensated out-of-hours on-call rota.
Getting involved in cross-cutting concerns that lift our entire engineering effort with the rest of the backend chapter.
Taking part in shaping all the work your squad does, not just the technical parts. Delivery is a team sport, and we encourage everyone at Cleo to share their ideas, so you can expect to be involved in product ideation sessions, user research calls, design reviews, retrospectives, ways of working sessions, product demos, OKR reviews.

Here are some examples, big and small, of the kinds of product feature work our engineers have taken part in over the last year:
Building a secured credit card from scratch to help our users improve their credit scores without changing their habits.
Launching our new budget rewind feature to help users understand their pay-cycle and provide them with better analysis of how they got on with their budget.
Adding discount plans and tiering options to our subscriptions so we can experiment with the best pricing for different types of users.
Whichever squad and part of the business you land in, you will ship changes multiple times a day to our hundreds of thousands of active users and seeing your work having a material impact on the financial health of those most in need.
About you
Firstly and most importantly, all of the above sounds exciting to you and you want to make a positive difference in society by improving the financial health of our users worldwide.
You’ve also read our company values and engineering principles which drive our ways of working and help us deliver working software to our users, learn what works and iterate quickly to improve it. You share and embrace these opinions and are passionate about using them to deliver value.
As this is a SE3-SE4 position we’re looking for someone who has strong industry experience of using Ruby on Rails for a minimum of 4 years. If it’s not quite that much, maybe you want to look at our standard Backend role, and if it’s much less you should look at our Graduate role.
What do you get for all your hard work?
A competitive compensation package (base + equity) with bi-annual reviews. You can view our public progression framework and salary bandings here: https://cleo-ai.progressionapp.com/engineering- This position is a SE3-SE4 level and we can pay£63,292-£96,792 p.a depending on experience.
Work at one of the fastest-growing tech startups, backed by top VC firms, Balderton & EQT Ventures
A clear progression plan. We want you to keep growing. That means trying new things, leading others, challenging the status quo and owning your impact. Always with our complete support.
Flexibility: We can’t fight for the world’s financial health if we’re not healthy ourselves. We work with everyone to make sure they have the balance they need to do their best work.
Work where you work best. We’re a globally distributed team. If you live in London we have a hybrid approach, we’d love you to spend one day a week or more in our beautiful office. If you’re outside of London, we’ll encourage you to spend a couple of days with us a few times per year. And we’ll cover your travel costs, naturally.
UK App access: The Cleo app is no longer downloadable in the UK (but only until next year). If you’re an existing user, you’ll still have access to the app. But some features won’t be available (just for a little while). Why? 99% of our users are based in the US–where financial health is often overlooked. We’ve decided to shift our focus to where we can provide the most value and make the greatest impact for users who need it most. Then we’ll be able to apply what we learn to better support our UK users in the future. Check out this page for more information.
25 days annual leave a year + public holidays (+ an additional day for every year you spend at Cleo)

· Work with Medical to ensure a complete evaluation of all competing therapies (on-market and in development), where appropriate investigate multiple sources or else demonstrate why there are no competition concerns over the medium-term horizon;
· Partner with in-house legal to develop deal legal documentation - term sheet through to definitive agreements;
· Regularly interact with senior stakeholders and keep management apprised of deal progress and decision points;
· Meet with licensing partners, biotech developers, brokers and CMOs to present Pharmanovia as a partner of choice and to discover the best pipeline opportunities;
· Represent Pharmanovia at external meetings, conferences, and seminars to assess new opportunities and to develop our external network, and serve as Pharmanovia’s representative at such events when required.

Every day, we fight for the world’s financial health, building a beloved AI that empowers people to make better financial decisions.
Backed by some of the most well-known investors in tech, we’ve reached over 4 million users and plan to double that number each year...which is where you come in.
We’re looking for a brilliant senior backend Ruby engineer to join us on our mission to fight for the world's financial health. You’ll be joining a team of adaptable, creative and product-focused engineers who ship working software. We understand our customers, we understand their pain, and we are passionate about helping them.
View how we run our Engineering Interview process here! https://web.meetcleo.com/blog/how-we-do-engineering-interviews-at-cleo
We strongly encourage applications from people of colour, the LGBTQ+ community, people with disabilities, neurodivergent people, parents, carers, and people from lower socio-economic backgrounds. If there’s anything we can do to accommodate your specific situation, please let us know. You can also see our latest DE&I report here.
What you’ll be doing:
Joining a cross-functional product squad with a mix of backend engineers, data analysts, frontend engineers, user researchers, designers, UX writers and others to develop features that improve our users ’financial health.
Collaborating with other leaders in your squad and pillar to provide technical insight into upcoming feature work, and leading the delivery of work by helping pull everyone together to get it shipped.
Mentoring your colleagues to help them become the best engineers they can be. You intentionally take time to share your skills and experiences with them and actively support their growth.
Working on our Ruby on Rails monolith to build out data models, background workers, JSON apis, and business logic services to support those product features.
Delivering your work wrapped in the tools and techniques we use to let us iterate quickly: tests, observability, AB-tests and feature flags.
Analysing data, wherever you might find it—querying our postgresql database, investigating our application logs, monitoring our stats and performance metrics, or digging into our quantitative user research data—to detect problems and come up with new ideas.
Supporting your colleagues by joining our in-hours support rota, and, optionally, joining our compensated out-of-hours on-call rota.
Getting involved in cross-cutting concerns that lift our entire engineering effort with the rest of the backend chapter.
Taking part in shaping all the work your squad does, not just the technical parts. Delivery is a team sport, and we encourage everyone at Cleo to share their ideas, so you can expect to be involved in product ideation sessions, user research calls, design reviews, retrospectives, ways of working sessions, product demos, OKR reviews.

Here are some examples, big and small, of the kinds of product feature work our engineers have taken part in over the last year:
Building a secured credit card from scratch to help our users improve their credit scores without changing their habits.
Launching our new budget rewind feature to help users understand their pay-cycle and provide them with better analysis of how they got on with their budget.
Adding discount plans and tiering options to our subscriptions so we can experiment with the best pricing for different types of users.
Whichever squad and part of the business you land in, you will ship changes multiple times a day to our hundreds of thousands of active users and seeing your work having a material impact on the financial health of those most in need.
About you
Firstly and most importantly, all of the above sounds exciting to you and you want to make a positive difference in society by improving the financial health of our users worldwide.
You’ve also read our company values and engineering principles which drive our ways of working and help us deliver working software to our users, learn what works and iterate quickly to improve it. You share and embrace these opinions and are passionate about using them to deliver value.
As this is a SE3-SE4 position we’re looking for someone who has strong industry experience of using Ruby on Rails for a minimum of 4 years. If it’s not quite that much, maybe you want to look at our standard Backend role, and if it’s much less you should look at our Graduate role.
What do you get for all your hard work?
A competitive compensation package (base + equity) with bi-annual reviews. You can view our public progression framework and salary bandings here: https://cleo-ai.progressionapp.com/engineering- This position is a SE3-SE4 level and we can pay£63,292-£96,792 p.a depending on experience.
Work at one of the fastest-growing tech startups, backed by top VC firms, Balderton & EQT Ventures
A clear progression plan. We want you to keep growing. That means trying new things, leading others, challenging the status quo and owning your impact. Always with our complete support.
Flexibility: We can’t fight for the world’s financial health if we’re not healthy ourselves. We work with everyone to make sure they have the balance they need to do their best work.
Work where you work best. We’re a globally distributed team. If you live in London we have a hybrid approach, we’d love you to spend one day a week or more in our beautiful office. If you’re outside of London, we’ll encourage you to spend a couple of days with us a few times per year. And we’ll cover your travel costs, naturally.
UK App access: The Cleo app is no longer downloadable in the UK (but only until next year). If you’re an existing user, you’ll still have access to the app. But some features won’t be available (just for a little while). Why? 99% of our users are based in the US–where financial health is often overlooked. We’ve decided to shift our focus to where we can provide the most value and make the greatest impact for users who need it most. Then we’ll be able to apply what we learn to better support our UK users in the future. Check out this page for more information.

Launching our new budget rewind feature to help users understand their pay-cycle and provide them with better analysis of how they got on with their budget.
Adding discount plans and tiering options to our subscriptions so we can experiment with the best pricing for different types of users.
Whichever squad and part of the business you land in, you will ship changes multiple times a day to our hundreds of thousands of active users and seeing your work having a material impact on the financial health of those most in need.
About you
Firstly and most importantly, all of the above sounds exciting to you and you want to make a positive difference in society by improving the financial health of our users worldwide.
You’ve also read our company values and engineering principles which drive our ways of working and help us deliver working software to our users, learn what works and iterate quickly to improve it. You share and embrace these opinions and are passionate about using them to deliver value.
As this is a SE3-SE4 position we’re looking for someone who has strong industry experience of using Ruby on Rails for a minimum of 4 years. If it’s not quite that much, maybe you want to look at our standard Backend role, and if it’s much less you should look at our Graduate role.
What do you get for all your hard work?
A competitive compensation package (base + equity) with bi-annual reviews. You can view our public progression framework and salary bandings here: https://cleo-ai.progressionapp.com/engineering- This position is a SE3-SE4 level and we can pay£63,292-£96,792 p.a depending on experience.
Work at one of the fastest-growing tech startups, backed by top VC firms, Balderton & EQT Ventures
A clear progression plan. We want you to keep growing. That means trying new things, leading others, challenging the status quo and owning your impact. Always with our complete support.
Flexibility: We can’t fight for the world’s financial health if we’re not healthy ourselves. We work with everyone to make sure they have the balance they need to do their best work.
Work where you work best. We’re a globally distributed team. If you live in London we have a hybrid approach, we’d love you to spend one day a week or more in our beautiful office. If you’re outside of London, we’ll encourage you to spend a couple of days with us a few times per year. And we’ll cover your travel costs, naturally.
UK App access: The Cleo app is no longer downloadable in the UK (but only until next year). If you’re an existing user, you’ll still have access to the app. But some features won’t be available (just for a little while). Why? 99% of our users are based in the US–where financial health is often overlooked. We’ve decided to shift our focus to where we can provide the most value and make the greatest impact for users who need it most. Then we’ll be able to apply what we learn to better support our UK users in the future. Check out this page for more information.

· Work with Medical to ensure a complete evaluation of all competing therapies (on-market and in development), where appropriate investigate multiple sources or else demonstrate why there are no competition concerns over the medium-term horizon;
· Partner with in-house legal to develop deal legal documentation - term sheet through to definitive agreements;
· Regularly interact with senior stakeholders and keep management apprised of deal progress and decision points;
· Meet with licensing partners, biotech developers, brokers and CMOs to present Pharmanovia as a partner of choice and to discover the best pipeline opportunities;

Every day, we fight for the world’s financial health, building a beloved AI that empowers people to make better financial decisions.
Backed by some of the most well-known investors in tech, we’ve reached over 4 million users and plan to double that number each year...which is where you come in.
We’re looking for a brilliant senior backend Ruby engineer to join us on our mission to fight for the world's financial health. You’ll be joining a team of adaptable, creative and product-focused engineers who ship working software. We understand our customers, we understand their pain, and we are passionate about helping them.
View how we run our Engineering Interview process here! https://web.meetcleo.com/blog/how-we-do-engineering-interviews-at-cleo
We strongly encourage applications from people of colour, the LGBTQ+ community, people with disabilities, neurodivergent people, parents, carers, and people from lower socio-economic backgrounds. If there’s anything we can do to accommodate your specific situation, please let us know. You can also see our latest DE&I report here.
What you’ll be doing:
Joining a cross-functional product squad with a mix of backend engineers, data analysts, frontend engineers, user researchers, designers, UX writers and others to develop features that improve our users ’financial health.
Collaborating with other leaders in your squad and pillar to provide technical insight into upcoming feature work, and leading the delivery of work by helping pull everyone together to get it shipped.
Mentoring your colleagues to help them become the best engineers they can be. You intentionally take time to share your skills and experiences with them and actively support their growth.
Working on our Ruby on Rails monolith to build out data models, background workers, JSON apis, and business logic services to support those product features.
Delivering your work wrapped in the tools and techniques we use to let us iterate quickly: tests, observability, AB-tests and feature flags.
Analysing data, wherever you might find it—querying our postgresql database, investigating our application logs, monitoring our stats and performance metrics, or digging into our quantitative user research data—to detect problems and come up with new ideas.
Supporting your colleagues by joining our in-hours support rota, and, optionally, joining our compensated out-of-hours on-call rota.
Getting involved in cross-cutting concerns that lift our entire engineering effort with the rest of the backend chapter.
Taking part in shaping all the work your squad does, not just the technical parts. Delivery is a team sport, and we encourage everyone at Cleo to share their ideas, so you can expect to be involved in product ideation sessions, user research calls, design reviews, retrospectives, ways of working sessions, product demos, OKR reviews.

Here are some examples, big and small, of the kinds of product feature work our engineers have taken part in over the last year:
Building a secured credit card from scratch to help our users improve their credit scores without changing their habits.
Launching our new budget rewind feature to help users understand their pay-cycle and provide them with better analysis of how they got on with their budget.
Adding discount plans and tiering options to our subscriptions so we can experiment with the best pricing for different types of users.
Whichever squad and part of the business you land in, you will ship changes multiple times a day to our hundreds of thousands of active users and seeing your work having a material impact on the financial health of those most in need.
About you
Firstly and most importantly, all of the above sounds exciting to you and you want to make a positive difference in society by improving the financial health of our users worldwide.
You’ve also read our company values and engineering principles which drive our ways of working and help us deliver working software to our users, learn what works and iterate quickly to improve it. You share and embrace these opinions and are passionate about using them to deliver value.
As this is a SE3-SE4 position we’re looking for someone who has strong industry experience of using Ruby on Rails for a minimum of 4 years. If it’s not quite that much, maybe you want to look at our standard Backend role, and if it’s much less you should look at our Graduate role.
What do you get for all your hard work?
A competitive compensation package (base + equity) with bi-annual reviews. You can view our public progression framework and salary bandings here: https://cleo-ai.progressionapp.com/engineering- This position is a SE3-SE4 level and we can pay£63,292-£96,792 p.a depending on experience.
Work at one of the fastest-growing tech startups, backed by top VC firms, Balderton & EQT Ventures
A clear progression plan. We want you to keep growing. That means trying new things, leading others, challenging the status quo and owning your impact. Always with our complete support.
Flexibility: We can’t fight for the world’s financial health if we’re not healthy ourselves. We work with everyone to make sure they have the balance they need to do their best work.
Work where you work best. We’re a globally distributed team. If you live in London we have a hybrid approach, we’d love you to spend one day a week or more in our beautiful office. If you’re outside of London, we’ll encourage you to spend a couple of days with us a few times per year. And we’ll cover your travel costs, naturally.
UK App access: The Cleo app is no longer downloadable in the UK (but only until next year). If you’re an existing user, you’ll still have access to the app. But some features won’t be available (just for a little while). Why? 99% of our users are based in the US–where financial health is often overlooked. We’ve decided to shift our focus to where we can provide the most value and make the greatest impact for users who need it most. Then we’ll be able to apply what we learn to better support our UK users in the future. Check out this page for more information.

Opportunities can take the form of licensing and co-development deals and you will have complete ownership of each assigned transaction for the entire life cycle of the deal: from coordinating the evaluation with other stakeholders and developing the deal thesis used to gain board approval, to planning the operational handover following completion. You will also be involved in identifying potential acquisition targets and from time to time coordinating their evaluation.

· Partner with CIU (Central Investment Unit) to develop a robust evidence-based business case for each opportunity and impactful board papers that clearly explain and justify the investment case;
· Coordinate internal and external diligence teams; appoint and oversee third-party consultants and advisors, to supplement our internal outputs;
· Work with Medical to ensure a complete evaluation of all competing therapies (on-market and in development), where appropriate investigate multiple sources or else demonstrate why there are no competition concerns over the medium-term horizon;
· Partner with in-house legal to develop deal legal documentation - term sheet through to definitive agreements;
· Regularly interact with senior stakeholders and keep management apprised of deal progress and decision points;
· Meet with licensing partners, biotech developers, brokers and CMOs to present Pharmanovia as a partner of choice and to discover the best pipeline opportunities;
· Represent Pharmanovia at external meetings, conferences, and seminars to assess new opportunities and to develop our external network, and serve as Pharmanovia’s representative at such events when required.
What we are looking for:

· Degree level education, preferably in science, ideally with further qualifications in business
· Track record of successful licensing deals (strong preference for Branded/Specialty)
· High performing generic/biosimilar licensing professionals will be considered

· Ability to multi-task, prioritise and deliver in a high-pressured environment
· Financial modelling experience
· Very strong oral and written communication skills
· Ability to build rapport with global multi-cultural teams and partners

Backed by some of the most well-known investors in tech, we’ve reached over 4 million users and plan to double that number each year...which is where you come in.
We’re looking for a brilliant senior backend Ruby engineer to join us on our mission to fight for the world's financial health. You’ll be joining a team of adaptable, creative and product-focused engineers who ship working software. We understand our customers, we understand their pain, and we are passionate about helping them.

We strongly encourage applications from people of colour, the LGBTQ+ community, people with disabilities, neurodivergent people, parents, carers, and people from lower socio-economic backgrounds. If there’s anything we can do to accommodate your specific situation, please let us know. You can also see our latest DE&I report here.
What you’ll be doing:
Joining a cross-functional product squad with a mix of backend engineers, data analysts, frontend engineers, user researchers, designers, UX writers and others to develop features that improve our users ’financial health.
Collaborating with other leaders in your squad and pillar to provide technical insight into upcoming feature work, and leading the delivery of work by helping pull everyone together to get it shipped.
Mentoring your colleagues to help them become the best engineers they can be. You intentionally take time to share your skills and experiences with them and actively support their growth.
Working on our Ruby on Rails monolith to build out data models, background workers, JSON apis, and business logic services to support those product features.
Delivering your work wrapped in the tools and techniques we use to let us iterate quickly: tests, observability, AB-tests and feature flags.
Analysing data, wherever you might find it—querying our postgresql database, investigating our application logs, monitoring our stats and performance metrics, or digging into our quantitative user research data—to detect problems and come up with new ideas.
Supporting your colleagues by joining our in-hours support rota, and, optionally, joining our compensated out-of-hours on-call rota.
Getting involved in cross-cutting concerns that lift our entire engineering effort with the rest of the backend chapter.
Taking part in shaping all the work your squad does, not just the technical parts. Delivery is a team sport, and we encourage everyone at Cleo to share their ideas, so you can expect to be involved in product ideation sessions, user research calls, design reviews, retrospectives, ways of working sessions, product demos, OKR reviews.

Here are some examples, big and small, of the kinds of product feature work our engineers have taken part in over the last year:
Building a secured credit card from scratch to help our users improve their credit scores without changing their habits.
Launching our new budget rewind feature to help users understand their pay-cycle and provide them with better analysis of how they got on with their budget.
Adding discount plans and tiering options to our subscriptions so we can experiment with the best pricing for different types of users.
Whichever squad and part of the business you land in, you will ship changes multiple times a day to our hundreds of thousands of active users and seeing your work having a material impact on the financial health of those most in need.
About you
Firstly and most importantly, all of the above sounds exciting to you and you want to make a positive difference in society by improving the financial health of our users worldwide.
You’ve also read our company values and engineering principles which drive our ways of working and help us deliver working software to our users, learn what works and iterate quickly to improve it. You share and embrace these opinions and are passionate about using them to deliver value.
As this is a SE3-SE4 position we’re looking for someone who has strong industry experience of using Ruby on Rails for a minimum of 4 years. If it’s not quite that much, maybe you want to look at our standard Backend role, and if it’s much less you should look at our Graduate role.
What do you get for all your hard work?
A competitive compensation package (base + equity) with bi-annual reviews. You can view our public progression framework and salary bandings here: https://cleo-ai.progressionapp.com/engineering- This position is a SE3-SE4 level and we can pay£63,292-£96,792 p.a depending on experience.
Work at one of the fastest-growing tech startups, backed by top VC firms, Balderton & EQT Ventures
A clear progression plan. We want you to keep growing. That means trying new things, leading others, challenging the status quo and owning your impact. Always with our complete support.
Flexibility: We can’t fight for the world’s financial health if we’re not healthy ourselves. We work with everyone to make sure they have the balance they need to do their best work.
Work where you work best. We’re a globally distributed team. If you live in London we have a hybrid approach, we’d love you to spend one day a week or more in our beautiful office. If you’re outside of London, we’ll encourage you to spend a couple of days with us a few times per year. And we’ll cover your travel costs, naturally.
UK App access: The Cleo app is no longer downloadable in the UK (but only until next year). If you’re an existing user, you’ll still have access to the app. But some features won’t be available (just for a little while). Why? 99% of our users are based in the US–where financial health is often overlooked. We’ve decided to shift our focus to where we can provide the most value and make the greatest impact for users who need it most. Then we’ll be able to apply what we learn to better support our UK users in the future. Check out this page for more information.

· Partner with in-house legal to develop deal legal documentation - term sheet through to definitive agreements;
· Regularly interact with senior stakeholders and keep management apprised of deal progress and decision points;
· Meet with licensing partners, biotech developers, brokers and CMOs to present Pharmanovia as a partner of choice and to discover the best pipeline opportunities;
· Represent Pharmanovia at external meetings, conferences, and seminars to assess new opportunities and to develop our external network, and serve as Pharmanovia’s representative at such events when required.

3.8",Senior Ruby Developer (Remote),"London, England",£35K (Employer Est.),"£77,500 /yr (est.)",1 to 50 Employees,2016,Company - Private,Information Technology Support Services,Information Technology,Unknown / Non-Applicable,3.9,4.2,3.9,3.8,3.5,"Most people come to Cleo to do work that matters. Every day, we fight for the world’s financial health, building a beloved AI that empowers people to make better financial decisions.
Backed by some of the most well-known investors in tech, we’ve reached over 4 million users and plan to double that number each year...which is where you come in.
We’re looking for a brilliant senior backend Ruby engineer to join us on our mission to fight for the world's financial health. You’ll be joining a team of adaptable, creative and product-focused engineers who ship working software. We understand our customers, we understand their pain, and we are passionate about helping them.
View how we run our Engineering Interview process here! https://web.meetcleo.com/blog/how-we-do-engineering-interviews-at-cleo
We strongly encourage applications from people of colour, the LGBTQ+ community, people with disabilities, neurodivergent people, parents, carers, and people from lower socio-economic backgrounds. If there’s anything we can do to accommodate your specific situation, please let us know. You can also see our latest DE&I report here.
What you’ll be doing:
Joining a cross-functional product squad with a mix of backend engineers, data analysts, frontend engineers, user researchers, designers, UX writers and others to develop features that improve our users ’financial health.
Collaborating with other leaders in your squad and pillar to provide technical insight into upcoming feature work, and leading the delivery of work by helping pull everyone together to get it shipped.
Mentoring your colleagues to help them become the best engineers they can be. You intentionally take time to share your skills and experiences with them and actively support their growth.
Working on our Ruby on Rails monolith to build out data models, background workers, JSON apis, and business logic services to support those product features.
Delivering your work wrapped in the tools and techniques we use to let us iterate quickly: tests, observability, AB-tests and feature flags.
Analysing data, wherever you might find it—querying our postgresql database, investigating our application logs, monitoring our stats and performance metrics, or digging into our quantitative user research data—to detect problems and come up with new ideas.
Supporting your colleagues by joining our in-hours support rota, and, optionally, joining our compensated out-of-hours on-call rota.
Getting involved in cross-cutting concerns that lift our entire engineering effort with the rest of the backend chapter.
Taking part in shaping all the work your squad does, not just the technical parts. Delivery is a team sport, and we encourage everyone at Cleo to share their ideas, so you can expect to be involved in product ideation sessions, user research calls, design reviews, retrospectives, ways of working sessions, product demos, OKR reviews.

Here are some examples, big and small, of the kinds of product feature work our engineers have taken part in over the last year:
Building a secured credit card from scratch to help our users improve their credit scores without changing their habits.
Launching our new budget rewind feature to help users understand their pay-cycle and provide them with better analysis of how they got on with their budget.
Adding discount plans and tiering options to our subscriptions so we can experiment with the best pricing for different types of users.
Whichever squad and part of the business you land in, you will ship changes multiple times a day to our hundreds of thousands of active users and seeing your work having a material impact on the financial health of those most in need.
About you
Firstly and most importantly, all of the above sounds exciting to you and you want to make a positive difference in society by improving the financial health of our users worldwide.
You’ve also read our company values and engineering principles which drive our ways of working and help us deliver working software to our users, learn what works and iterate quickly to improve it. You share and embrace these opinions and are passionate about using them to deliver value.
As this is a SE3-SE4 position we’re looking for someone who has strong industry experience of using Ruby on Rails for a minimum of 4 years. If it’s not quite that much, maybe you want to look at our standard Backend role, and if it’s much less you should look at our Graduate role.
What do you get for all your hard work?
A competitive compensation package (base + equity) with bi-annual reviews. You can view our public progression framework and salary bandings here: https://cleo-ai.progressionapp.com/engineering- This position is a SE3-SE4 level and we can pay£63,292-£96,792 p.a depending on experience.
Work at one of the fastest-growing tech startups, backed by top VC firms, Balderton & EQT Ventures
A clear progression plan. We want you to keep growing. That means trying new things, leading others, challenging the status quo and owning your impact. Always with our complete support.
Flexibility: We can’t fight for the world’s financial health if we’re not healthy ourselves. We work with everyone to make sure they have the balance they need to do their best work.
Work where you work best. We’re a globally distributed team. If you live in London we have a hybrid approach, we’d love you to spend one day a week or more in our beautiful office. If you’re outside of London, we’ll encourage you to spend a couple of days with us a few times per year. And we’ll cover your travel costs, naturally.
UK App access: The Cleo app is no longer downloadable in the UK (but only until next year). If you’re an existing user, you’ll still have access to the app. But some features won’t be available (just for a little while). Why? 99% of our users are based in the US–where financial health is often overlooked. We’ve decided to shift our focus to where we can provide the most value and make the greatest impact for users who need it most. Then we’ll be able to apply what we learn to better support our UK users in the future. Check out this page for more information.

· Partner with in-house legal to develop deal legal documentation - term sheet through to definitive agreements;
· Regularly interact with senior stakeholders and keep management apprised of deal progress and decision points;
· Meet with licensing partners, biotech developers, brokers and CMOs to present Pharmanovia as a partner of choice and to discover the best pipeline opportunities;

Every day, we fight for the world’s financial health, building a beloved AI that empowers people to make better financial decisions.
Backed by some of the most well-known investors in tech, we’ve reached over 4 million users and plan to double that number each year...which is where you come in.
We’re looking for a brilliant senior backend Ruby engineer to join us on our mission to fight for the world's financial health. You’ll be joining a team of adaptable, creative and product-focused engineers who ship working software. We understand our customers, we understand their pain, and we are passionate about helping them.
View how we run our Engineering Interview process here! https://web.meetcleo.com/blog/how-we-do-engineering-interviews-at-cleo
We strongly encourage applications from people of colour, the LGBTQ+ community, people with disabilities, neurodivergent people, parents, carers, and people from lower socio-economic backgrounds. If there’s anything we can do to accommodate your specific situation, please let us know. You can also see our latest DE&I report here.
What you’ll be doing:
Joining a cross-functional product squad with a mix of backend engineers, data analysts, frontend engineers, user researchers, designers, UX writers and others to develop features that improve our users ’financial health.
Collaborating with other leaders in your squad and pillar to provide technical insight into upcoming feature work, and leading the delivery of work by helping pull everyone together to get it shipped.
Mentoring your colleagues to help them become the best engineers they can be. You intentionally take time to share your skills and experiences with them and actively support their growth.
Working on our Ruby on Rails monolith to build out data models, background workers, JSON apis, and business logic services to support those product features.
Delivering your work wrapped in the tools and techniques we use to let us iterate quickly: tests, observability, AB-tests and feature flags.
Analysing data, wherever you might find it—querying our postgresql database, investigating our application logs, monitoring our stats and performance metrics, or digging into our quantitative user research data—to detect problems and come up with new ideas.
Supporting your colleagues by joining our in-hours support rota, and, optionally, joining our compensated out-of-hours on-call rota.
Getting involved in cross-cutting concerns that lift our entire engineering effort with the rest of the backend chapter.
Taking part in shaping all the work your squad does, not just the technical parts. Delivery is a team sport, and we encourage everyone at Cleo to share their ideas, so you can expect to be involved in product ideation sessions, user research calls, design reviews, retrospectives, ways of working sessions, product demos, OKR reviews.

Here are some examples, big and small, of the kinds of product feature work our engineers have taken part in over the last year:
Building a secured credit card from scratch to help our users improve their credit scores without changing their habits.
Launching our new budget rewind feature to help users understand their pay-cycle and provide them with better analysis of how they got on with their budget.
Adding discount plans and tiering options to our subscriptions so we can experiment with the best pricing for different types of users.
Whichever squad and part of the business you land in, you will ship changes multiple times a day to our hundreds of thousands of active users and seeing your work having a material impact on the financial health of those most in need.
About you
Firstly and most importantly, all of the above sounds exciting to you and you want to make a positive difference in society by improving the financial health of our users worldwide.
You’ve also read our company values and engineering principles which drive our ways of working and help us deliver working software to our users, learn what works and iterate quickly to improve it. You share and embrace these opinions and are passionate about using them to deliver value.
As this is a SE3-SE4 position we’re looking for someone who has strong industry experience of using Ruby on Rails for a minimum of 4 years. If it’s not quite that much, maybe you want to look at our standard Backend role, and if it’s much less you should look at our Graduate role.
What do you get for all your hard work?
A competitive compensation package (base + equity) with bi-annual reviews. You can view our public progression framework and salary bandings here: https://cleo-ai.progressionapp.com/engineering- This position is a SE3-SE4 level and we can pay£63,292-£96,792 p.a depending on experience.
Work at one of the fastest-growing tech startups, backed by top VC firms, Balderton & EQT Ventures
A clear progression plan. We want you to keep growing. That means trying new things, leading others, challenging the status quo and owning your impact. Always with our complete support.
Flexibility: We can’t fight for the world’s financial health if we’re not healthy ourselves. We work with everyone to make sure they have the balance they need to do their best work.
Work where you work best. We’re a globally distributed team. If you live in London we have a hybrid approach, we’d love you to spend one day a week or more in our beautiful office. If you’re outside of London, we’ll encourage you to spend a couple of days with us a few times per year. And we’ll cover your travel costs, naturally.
UK App access: The Cleo app is no longer downloadable in the UK (but only until next year). If you’re an existing user, you’ll still have access to the app. But some features won’t be available (just for a little while). Why? 99% of our users are based in the US–where financial health is often overlooked. We’ve decided to shift our focus to where we can provide the most value and make the greatest impact for users who need it most. Then we’ll be able to apply what we learn to better support our UK users in the future. Check out this page for more information.
