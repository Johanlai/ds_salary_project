Society’s data superpowers are gathering dust due to a problem that is easy to describe but hard to solve: The data required to solve the world's most pressing problems isn't the kind that's easily shared.
The limitations of current data infrastructure have created painful, slow, expensive and often ineffective workarounds for what should be seamless collaborations between trusted partners. But it doesn't have to be this way. ‍So we're building a missing piece of global infrastructure: a secure network to enable organisations to send algorithms to data. This means they can share the benefits of their data with each other, without having to go through the painful and risky process of moving it around, without compromising its privacy, and without even needing to expose any raw data.
Right now, we’re heads-down on applying our platform to the problem of clinical trial recruitment in the Healthcare space. We’re enabling privacy-preserving collaboration between healthcare providers and pharmaceutical companies, which will remove a major friction point in the process, and help ensure critical medicines make it through trials and into the hands of those who need them much sooner.
We believe that great software is built by great people working in great teams, and we’re working hard to make Bitfount a home for both. We’re committed to building an organisation that people are proud to be part of, where everyone can learn and grow, where everyone is supported, and where everyone can do the best, most meaningful work of their careers in a cross-disciplinary environment. Everyone’s viewpoint is valued and we work hard to foster a culture of open discussion. We’re backed by top UK and international investors and a stellar advisory team.

We're tackling lots of really interesting problems at the intersection of AI, ML and Analytics workflows, privacy, security, and enterprise functionality (e.g. for healthcare) across a number of apps and use-cases. You'll be part of a strong cross-functional team (product, design, engineering).
You should be comfortable with high quality software practices (including code-reviews, testing practices, and software design), happy to work in a diverse team, be willing to participate in our team-led discussions, and generally be interested in making sure artificial intelligence and data are used to make the world a better place.
Your work will include:
Working with product managers, front-end and full-stack engineers to build and grow the python backend that powers our app and web products
Developing a flexible yet robust backend that allows users to build machine learning models and perform data analytics whilst preserving privacy
Contributing to the process of planning, scoping and fleshing out projects we tackle during our development cycles
Supporting customers where necessary, ensuring they’re able to use the platform effectively for their use-case

Wagestream is on a mission to bring better financial wellbeing to frontline workers.We partner with some of the world’s most famous employers, like Pizza Express, Hilton and the UK’s National Health Service, to give their teams access to fairer financial services - all built around flexible pay. Almost a million people can now choose how often they’re paid, track their shifts and earnings, start saving, use budgeting tools, get free financial coaching, and access fairer financial products.
All in one financial wellbeing super-app. Wagestream is unique: VC-backed and growing at scale-up pace, but with a social conscience.
The UK’s leading financial charities and impact funds were our founding investors, and we operate on a social charter - which means every product we build has to improve financial health and reduce the $5.6bn ‘premium’ lower-income earners pay for financial services each year.You’d be joining a team of 100 talented, ambitious people, growing in Europe, Australia and the USA, building a category-leading fintech product and all united by that same mission.
The Opportunity:
When an employer signs up for Wagestream, we build and deploy integrations with their payroll, HR and WFM (workforce management) systems so that we know about their employees and how much they have worked and earned. Although we've done hundreds of these integrations already, each one is a little bit unique and there are many more out there.
Forming part of a Squad focussed on launching clients, you will be at the heart of our mission, empowering people around the world to access their income as they earn it. With the support of our Sales Engineers and Delivery Managers, you will work directly with customers to integrate their systems with those of Wagestream, as well as on larger system level pieces of work to improve the platform functionality.
Every company uses slightly different terminology, jargon and data models, so the core engineering challenge is figuring out how to adapt and normalise these idiosyncrasies into a common framework, through both engineered and negotiated solutions.

The technology stack is AWS+Python+Postgres. You should also have a strong command of SQL and of cloud-based architectures.

Requirements
What will you be doing:
Architect, develop, test, and maintain code to integrate with third-party payroll, HR and WFM systems and enable the processing of this data.
Interface with client IT teams, where needed, to extract information and guide solutions.
Contribute on best practices, tools and technologies.
Actually launching Wagestream to our users!

About Cleo
Most people come to Cleo to do work that matters. Every day, we fight for the world’s financial health, building a beloved AI that empowers people to make better financial decisions.
Backed by some of the most well-known investors in tech, we’ve reached over 5 million users and plan to double that number each year...which is where you come in.
We’re looking for a brilliant Senior Platform engineer to join us on our mission to fight for the world's financial health. You’ll be joining a team of adaptable, creative and product-focused platform engineers who help our company iterate faster. We understand our customers, we understand their pain, and we are passionate about helping them.
We’re looking for exceptional Senior Platform Engineers who are excited about scaling a software and data platform to support a growing team and customer base. Our platform stack consists of Ruby, Python, and Terraform and runs on Heroku, AWS, and Kubernetes.
What you’ll be doing:
Joining a multi-discipline platform team that’s constantly iterating on our platform, which forms the backbone for the meetcleo app, as well as internal data products.
Collaborate with product and data squads, as well as a variety of discipline-specific chapters to prioritise and build tooling to enable the company to move faster on its priorities.
Take part in deciding where to invest in tooling and technologies to help us scale, both in terms of growing our user base, and growing our technology team.
Help us find the sweet spot in terms of speed of development, quality, security, and cost, to serve the needs of Cleo at this stage of our business.
Share knowledge and solicit feedback on proposals via multiple mediums including: writing documentation (we use Notion), sharing info on Slack, and presenting over Zoom in chapter and/or company meetings.
Collaborating with other leaders in your team to provide technical insight into upcoming platform work, and leading the delivery of work by helping pull everyone together to get it shipped.
Mentoring your colleagues to help them become the best engineers they can be. You intentionally take time to share your skills and experiences with them and actively support their growth.
Working with our Ruby on Rails monolith, Postgres database, Redis store, Kubernetes cluster, Redshift database, and Kafka event bus to ensure we have adequate monitoring, alerting, and runbooks so that we can find and fix issues quickly when things go wrong.
Analysing data, wherever you might find it — querying our postgresql database, investigating our application logs, monitoring our stats and performance metrics — to detect problems and come up with new ideas. Using data to inform decisions about platform improvements as well as health of the platform.
Supporting your colleagues by joining our in-hours support rota, and, optionally, joining our compensated out-of-hours on-call rota.
Taking part in shaping all the work your squad does, not just the technical parts. Delivery is a team sport, and we encourage everyone at Cleo to share their ideas, so you can expect to be involved in ideation sessions, architecture reviews, retrospectives, ways of working sessions, OKR reviews.
Here are some examples, big and small, of the kinds of platform feature work our engineers have taken part in over the last year:
Provided a more robust and repeatable means to build and update our cloud infrastructure by migrating our infrastructure into Terraform. This has enabled us to rapidly build out new areas of our platform, including Kubernetes - in which we’ve been able to provide on-demand sandboxes for our data team to do data processing.
Enabled our platform to scale in terms of our ability to capture analytics events by implementing an event bus with Kafka and S3 data sink. We were then able to migrate existing events into new event capture system to reduce burden of event processing on Rails monolith.
Enhanced the company’s ability to experience Cleo as any customer would, regardless of country. We built an extensible framework that enabled us to simulate our partners APIs in non-production environments and provided tooling for any Cleo employee to generate a realistic testing user.
As part of the platform team, you will ship changes multiple times a day to our growing group of Cleoites and see your work having a material impact on the financial health of hundreds of thousands of active users.
About you
Firstly and most importantly, all of the above sounds exciting to you and you want to make a positive difference in society by improving the financial health of our users worldwide.
We’re looking for someone who has strong industry experience (a minimum of 2 years) and an eagerness to cross-train to use ruby on rails and/or python to do this at Cleo. Examples of the types of experience that might be applicable include working as…
A polyglot engineer at a startup where you had platform/dev-ops responsibilities.
A platform engineer, ideally using AWS.
A fully hands-on SRE.
A dev-ops engineer experienced with Postgres.
You’ve also read our company values and engineering principles which drive our ways of working and help us deliver working software to our users, learn what works and iterate quickly to improve it. You share and embrace these opinions and are passionate about using them to deliver value.
Why should I apply?
There’s a clear engineering career growth framework. Whether you want to develop your career as a sole contributor or head down the engineering management track, you can grow with us!
You’ll be joining an open and collaborative team where you’ll be heard and get to make a difference.

Society’s data superpowers are gathering dust due to a problem that is easy to describe but hard to solve: The data required to solve the world's most pressing problems isn't the kind that's easily shared.
The limitations of current data infrastructure have created painful, slow, expensive and often ineffective workarounds for what should be seamless collaborations between trusted partners. But it doesn't have to be this way. ‍So we're building a missing piece of global infrastructure: a secure network to enable organisations to send algorithms to data. This means they can share the benefits of their data with each other, without having to go through the painful and risky process of moving it around, without compromising its privacy, and without even needing to expose any raw data.
Right now, we’re heads-down on applying our platform to the problem of clinical trial recruitment in the Healthcare space. We’re enabling privacy-preserving collaboration between healthcare providers and pharmaceutical companies, which will remove a major friction point in the process, and help ensure critical medicines make it through trials and into the hands of those who need them much sooner.
We believe that great software is built by great people working in great teams, and we’re working hard to make Bitfount a home for both. We’re committed to building an organisation that people are proud to be part of, where everyone can learn and grow, where everyone is supported, and where everyone can do the best, most meaningful work of their careers in a cross-disciplinary environment. Everyone’s viewpoint is valued and we work hard to foster a culture of open discussion. We’re backed by top UK and international investors and a stellar advisory team.

We're tackling lots of really interesting problems at the intersection of AI, ML and Analytics workflows, privacy, security, and enterprise functionality (e.g. for healthcare) across a number of apps and use-cases. You'll be part of a strong cross-functional team (product, design, engineering).
You should be comfortable with high quality software practices (including code-reviews, testing practices, and software design), happy to work in a diverse team, be willing to participate in our team-led discussions, and generally be interested in making sure artificial intelligence and data are used to make the world a better place.
Your work will include:
Working with product managers, front-end and full-stack engineers to build and grow the python backend that powers our app and web products
Developing a flexible yet robust backend that allows users to build machine learning models and perform data analytics whilst preserving privacy
Contributing to the process of planning, scoping and fleshing out projects we tackle during our development cycles
Supporting customers where necessary, ensuring they’re able to use the platform effectively for their use-case
Helping to shape engineering standards, practices and culture at Bitfount

Have an excellent working knowledge of Python
Either have some experience using PyTorch/TensorFlow for machine learning or using NumPy for general data science tasks

Have experience developing and running build, test, and deployment tools in production environments

Society’s data superpowers are gathering dust due to a problem that is easy to describe but hard to solve: The data required to solve the world's most pressing problems isn't the kind that's easily shared.
The limitations of current data infrastructure have created painful, slow, expensive and often ineffective workarounds for what should be seamless collaborations between trusted partners. But it doesn't have to be this way. ‍So we're building a missing piece of global infrastructure: a secure network to enable organisations to send algorithms to data. This means they can share the benefits of their data with each other, without having to go through the painful and risky process of moving it around, without compromising its privacy, and without even needing to expose any raw data.
Right now, we’re heads-down on applying our platform to the problem of clinical trial recruitment in the Healthcare space. We’re enabling privacy-preserving collaboration between healthcare providers and pharmaceutical companies, which will remove a major friction point in the process, and help ensure critical medicines make it through trials and into the hands of those who need them much sooner.
We believe that great software is built by great people working in great teams, and we’re working hard to make Bitfount a home for both. We’re committed to building an organisation that people are proud to be part of, where everyone can learn and grow, where everyone is supported, and where everyone can do the best, most meaningful work of their careers in a cross-disciplinary environment. Everyone’s viewpoint is valued and we work hard to foster a culture of open discussion. We’re backed by top UK and international investors and a stellar advisory team.

The role
Bitfount is looking for a motivated, experienced, mid or senior-level Python Software Engineer to join our Engineering team and contribute to the development of the federated ML and analytics python framework, which is a crucial component of our SaaS product. We're tackling lots of really interesting problems at the intersection of AI, ML and Analytics workflows, privacy, security, and enterprise functionality (e.g. for healthcare) across a number of apps and use-cases. You'll be part of a strong cross-functional team (product, design, engineering).
You should be comfortable with high quality software practices (including code-reviews, testing practices, and software design), happy to work in a diverse team, be willing to participate in our team-led discussions, and generally be interested in making sure artificial intelligence and data are used to make the world a better place.
Your work will include:
Working with product managers, front-end and full-stack engineers to build and grow the python backend that powers our app and web products
Developing a flexible yet robust backend that allows users to build machine learning models and perform data analytics whilst preserving privacy
Contributing to the process of planning, scoping and fleshing out projects we tackle during our development cycles
Supporting customers where necessary, ensuring they’re able to use the platform effectively for their use-case
Helping to shape engineering standards, practices and culture at Bitfount
You may be fit for this role if you:
3+ years of relevant experience designing and building software applications at a tech-forward software company
Have an excellent working knowledge of Python
Either have some experience using PyTorch/TensorFlow for machine learning or using NumPy for general data science tasks
You either already have a solid understanding of machine learning theory and practical challenges around training and deploying machine learning models or are enthusiastic about working on a ML-driven product team and learning about these topics
Bonus points for experience with privacy, security
Bonus points for qualifications in machine learning
Can pick things up quickly and adapt
Have solid knowledge of python unit testing
Have experience developing and running build, test, and deployment tools in production environments
Strong communication skills to bridge the gap between design, product, and engineering
Highly curious; not satisfied with getting something to work, you want to understand why it works and how to improve the quality of the product/software

We do not discriminate on the basis of ethnicity, religion, sexual orientation, gender identity, family or parental status, national origin, veteran, neurodiversity status or disability status.

All in one financial wellbeing super-app. Wagestream is unique: VC-backed and growing at scale-up pace, but with a social conscience.

Society’s data superpowers are gathering dust due to a problem that is easy to describe but hard to solve: The data required to solve the world's most pressing problems isn't the kind that's easily shared.
The limitations of current data infrastructure have created painful, slow, expensive and often ineffective workarounds for what should be seamless collaborations between trusted partners. But it doesn't have to be this way. ‍So we're building a missing piece of global infrastructure: a secure network to enable organisations to send algorithms to data. This means they can share the benefits of their data with each other, without having to go through the painful and risky process of moving it around, without compromising its privacy, and without even needing to expose any raw data.
Right now, we’re heads-down on applying our platform to the problem of clinical trial recruitment in the Healthcare space. We’re enabling privacy-preserving collaboration between healthcare providers and pharmaceutical companies, which will remove a major friction point in the process, and help ensure critical medicines make it through trials and into the hands of those who need them much sooner.
We believe that great software is built by great people working in great teams, and we’re working hard to make Bitfount a home for both. We’re committed to building an organisation that people are proud to be part of, where everyone can learn and grow, where everyone is supported, and where everyone can do the best, most meaningful work of their careers in a cross-disciplinary environment. Everyone’s viewpoint is valued and we work hard to foster a culture of open discussion. We’re backed by top UK and international investors and a stellar advisory team.

The role
Bitfount is looking for a motivated, experienced, mid or senior-level Python Software Engineer to join our Engineering team and contribute to the development of the federated ML and analytics python framework, which is a crucial component of our SaaS product. We're tackling lots of really interesting problems at the intersection of AI, ML and Analytics workflows, privacy, security, and enterprise functionality (e.g. for healthcare) across a number of apps and use-cases. You'll be part of a strong cross-functional team (product, design, engineering).
You should be comfortable with high quality software practices (including code-reviews, testing practices, and software design), happy to work in a diverse team, be willing to participate in our team-led discussions, and generally be interested in making sure artificial intelligence and data are used to make the world a better place.
Your work will include:
Working with product managers, front-end and full-stack engineers to build and grow the python backend that powers our app and web products
Developing a flexible yet robust backend that allows users to build machine learning models and perform data analytics whilst preserving privacy
Contributing to the process of planning, scoping and fleshing out projects we tackle during our development cycles
Supporting customers where necessary, ensuring they’re able to use the platform effectively for their use-case
Helping to shape engineering standards, practices and culture at Bitfount

3+ years of relevant experience designing and building software applications at a tech-forward software company
Have an excellent working knowledge of Python
Either have some experience using PyTorch/TensorFlow for machine learning or using NumPy for general data science tasks
You either already have a solid understanding of machine learning theory and practical challenges around training and deploying machine learning models or are enthusiastic about working on a ML-driven product team and learning about these topics
Bonus points for experience with privacy, security
Bonus points for qualifications in machine learning
Can pick things up quickly and adapt
Have solid knowledge of python unit testing
Have experience developing and running build, test, and deployment tools in production environments
Strong communication skills to bridge the gap between design, product, and engineering

Society’s data superpowers are gathering dust due to a problem that is easy to describe but hard to solve: The data required to solve the world's most pressing problems isn't the kind that's easily shared.
The limitations of current data infrastructure have created painful, slow, expensive and often ineffective workarounds for what should be seamless collaborations between trusted partners. But it doesn't have to be this way. ‍So we're building a missing piece of global infrastructure: a secure network to enable organisations to send algorithms to data. This means they can share the benefits of their data with each other, without having to go through the painful and risky process of moving it around, without compromising its privacy, and without even needing to expose any raw data.
Right now, we’re heads-down on applying our platform to the problem of clinical trial recruitment in the Healthcare space. We’re enabling privacy-preserving collaboration between healthcare providers and pharmaceutical companies, which will remove a major friction point in the process, and help ensure critical medicines make it through trials and into the hands of those who need them much sooner.
We believe that great software is built by great people working in great teams, and we’re working hard to make Bitfount a home for both. We’re committed to building an organisation that people are proud to be part of, where everyone can learn and grow, where everyone is supported, and where everyone can do the best, most meaningful work of their careers in a cross-disciplinary environment. Everyone’s viewpoint is valued and we work hard to foster a culture of open discussion. We’re backed by top UK and international investors and a stellar advisory team.

The role
Bitfount is looking for a motivated, experienced, mid or senior-level Python Software Engineer to join our Engineering team and contribute to the development of the federated ML and analytics python framework, which is a crucial component of our SaaS product. We're tackling lots of really interesting problems at the intersection of AI, ML and Analytics workflows, privacy, security, and enterprise functionality (e.g. for healthcare) across a number of apps and use-cases. You'll be part of a strong cross-functional team (product, design, engineering).
You should be comfortable with high quality software practices (including code-reviews, testing practices, and software design), happy to work in a diverse team, be willing to participate in our team-led discussions, and generally be interested in making sure artificial intelligence and data are used to make the world a better place.
Your work will include:
Working with product managers, front-end and full-stack engineers to build and grow the python backend that powers our app and web products
Developing a flexible yet robust backend that allows users to build machine learning models and perform data analytics whilst preserving privacy
Contributing to the process of planning, scoping and fleshing out projects we tackle during our development cycles
Supporting customers where necessary, ensuring they’re able to use the platform effectively for their use-case
Helping to shape engineering standards, practices and culture at Bitfount
You may be fit for this role if you:
3+ years of relevant experience designing and building software applications at a tech-forward software company
Have an excellent working knowledge of Python
Either have some experience using PyTorch/TensorFlow for machine learning or using NumPy for general data science tasks
You either already have a solid understanding of machine learning theory and practical challenges around training and deploying machine learning models or are enthusiastic about working on a ML-driven product team and learning about these topics
Bonus points for experience with privacy, security
Bonus points for qualifications in machine learning
Can pick things up quickly and adapt
Have solid knowledge of python unit testing
Have experience developing and running build, test, and deployment tools in production environments
Strong communication skills to bridge the gap between design, product, and engineering
Highly curious; not satisfied with getting something to work, you want to understand why it works and how to improve the quality of the product/software

We do not discriminate on the basis of ethnicity, religion, sexual orientation, gender identity, family or parental status, national origin, veteran, neurodiversity status or disability status.

Society’s data superpowers are gathering dust due to a problem that is easy to describe but hard to solve: The data required to solve the world's most pressing problems isn't the kind that's easily shared.
The limitations of current data infrastructure have created painful, slow, expensive and often ineffective workarounds for what should be seamless collaborations between trusted partners. But it doesn't have to be this way. ‍So we're building a missing piece of global infrastructure: a secure network to enable organisations to send algorithms to data. This means they can share the benefits of their data with each other, without having to go through the painful and risky process of moving it around, without compromising its privacy, and without even needing to expose any raw data.
Right now, we’re heads-down on applying our platform to the problem of clinical trial recruitment in the Healthcare space. We’re enabling privacy-preserving collaboration between healthcare providers and pharmaceutical companies, which will remove a major friction point in the process, and help ensure critical medicines make it through trials and into the hands of those who need them much sooner.
We believe that great software is built by great people working in great teams, and we’re working hard to make Bitfount a home for both. We’re committed to building an organisation that people are proud to be part of, where everyone can learn and grow, where everyone is supported, and where everyone can do the best, most meaningful work of their careers in a cross-disciplinary environment. Everyone’s viewpoint is valued and we work hard to foster a culture of open discussion. We’re backed by top UK and international investors and a stellar advisory team.

We were recently voted one of the world’s most disruptive companies on the Disrupt 100 List and are well funded with the aim to take even more funding in the coming months to support our ambitious growth plan. Our biggest asset, though, is our people. We have an open culture where everyone’s opinion is heard and everyone has the opportunity to shape the future of our technology. At our size, every developer is crucial and has a big impact on our final product.
Finally, we are having a big impact on the world. The factories we optimise create things that are all around us. They’re in the device you’re reading this on and countless other devices in your home. They’re used in healthcare, aviation, automotive, robotics, communications, IoT and many more and they’re in limited supply making our software even more vital to our customers who are under pressure to increase output. In short, there’s never been a better time to join Flexciton.
At Flexciton, we value diversity and foster an inclusive environment. We are committed to equal employment opportunity and we want to ensure that our recruitment process is accessible to everyone.

Society’s data superpowers are gathering dust due to a problem that is easy to describe but hard to solve: The data required to solve the world's most pressing problems isn't the kind that's easily shared.
The limitations of current data infrastructure have created painful, slow, expensive and often ineffective workarounds for what should be seamless collaborations between trusted partners. But it doesn't have to be this way. ‍So we're building a missing piece of global infrastructure: a secure network to enable organisations to send algorithms to data. This means they can share the benefits of their data with each other, without having to go through the painful and risky process of moving it around, without compromising its privacy, and without even needing to expose any raw data.
Right now, we’re heads-down on applying our platform to the problem of clinical trial recruitment in the Healthcare space. We’re enabling privacy-preserving collaboration between healthcare providers and pharmaceutical companies, which will remove a major friction point in the process, and help ensure critical medicines make it through trials and into the hands of those who need them much sooner.
We believe that great software is built by great people working in great teams, and we’re working hard to make Bitfount a home for both. We’re committed to building an organisation that people are proud to be part of, where everyone can learn and grow, where everyone is supported, and where everyone can do the best, most meaningful work of their careers in a cross-disciplinary environment. Everyone’s viewpoint is valued and we work hard to foster a culture of open discussion. We’re backed by top UK and international investors and a stellar advisory team.

The role
Bitfount is looking for a motivated, experienced, mid or senior-level Python Software Engineer to join our Engineering team and contribute to the development of the federated ML and analytics python framework, which is a crucial component of our SaaS product. We're tackling lots of really interesting problems at the intersection of AI, ML and Analytics workflows, privacy, security, and enterprise functionality (e.g. for healthcare) across a number of apps and use-cases. You'll be part of a strong cross-functional team (product, design, engineering).
You should be comfortable with high quality software practices (including code-reviews, testing practices, and software design), happy to work in a diverse team, be willing to participate in our team-led discussions, and generally be interested in making sure artificial intelligence and data are used to make the world a better place.
Your work will include:
Working with product managers, front-end and full-stack engineers to build and grow the python backend that powers our app and web products
Developing a flexible yet robust backend that allows users to build machine learning models and perform data analytics whilst preserving privacy
Contributing to the process of planning, scoping and fleshing out projects we tackle during our development cycles
Supporting customers where necessary, ensuring they’re able to use the platform effectively for their use-case
Helping to shape engineering standards, practices and culture at Bitfount
You may be fit for this role if you:
3+ years of relevant experience designing and building software applications at a tech-forward software company
Have an excellent working knowledge of Python
Either have some experience using PyTorch/TensorFlow for machine learning or using NumPy for general data science tasks
You either already have a solid understanding of machine learning theory and practical challenges around training and deploying machine learning models or are enthusiastic about working on a ML-driven product team and learning about these topics
Bonus points for experience with privacy, security
Bonus points for qualifications in machine learning
Can pick things up quickly and adapt
Have solid knowledge of python unit testing
Have experience developing and running build, test, and deployment tools in production environments
Strong communication skills to bridge the gap between design, product, and engineering
Highly curious; not satisfied with getting something to work, you want to understand why it works and how to improve the quality of the product/software

We do not discriminate on the basis of ethnicity, religion, sexual orientation, gender identity, family or parental status, national origin, veteran, neurodiversity status or disability status.

Society’s data superpowers are gathering dust due to a problem that is easy to describe but hard to solve: The data required to solve the world's most pressing problems isn't the kind that's easily shared.
The limitations of current data infrastructure have created painful, slow, expensive and often ineffective workarounds for what should be seamless collaborations between trusted partners. But it doesn't have to be this way. ‍So we're building a missing piece of global infrastructure: a secure network to enable organisations to send algorithms to data. This means they can share the benefits of their data with each other, without having to go through the painful and risky process of moving it around, without compromising its privacy, and without even needing to expose any raw data.
Right now, we’re heads-down on applying our platform to the problem of clinical trial recruitment in the Healthcare space. We’re enabling privacy-preserving collaboration between healthcare providers and pharmaceutical companies, which will remove a major friction point in the process, and help ensure critical medicines make it through trials and into the hands of those who need them much sooner.
We believe that great software is built by great people working in great teams, and we’re working hard to make Bitfount a home for both.

Society’s data superpowers are gathering dust due to a problem that is easy to describe but hard to solve: The data required to solve the world's most pressing problems isn't the kind that's easily shared.
The limitations of current data infrastructure have created painful, slow, expensive and often ineffective workarounds for what should be seamless collaborations between trusted partners. But it doesn't have to be this way. ‍So we're building a missing piece of global infrastructure: a secure network to enable organisations to send algorithms to data. This means they can share the benefits of their data with each other, without having to go through the painful and risky process of moving it around, without compromising its privacy, and without even needing to expose any raw data.
Right now, we’re heads-down on applying our platform to the problem of clinical trial recruitment in the Healthcare space. We’re enabling privacy-preserving collaboration between healthcare providers and pharmaceutical companies, which will remove a major friction point in the process, and help ensure critical medicines make it through trials and into the hands of those who need them much sooner.
We believe that great software is built by great people working in great teams, and we’re working hard to make Bitfount a home for both. We’re committed to building an organisation that people are proud to be part of, where everyone can learn and grow, where everyone is supported, and where everyone can do the best, most meaningful work of their careers in a cross-disciplinary environment. Everyone’s viewpoint is valued and we work hard to foster a culture of open discussion. We’re backed by top UK and international investors and a stellar advisory team.

Bitfount is looking for a motivated, experienced, mid or senior-level Python Software Engineer to join our Engineering team and contribute to the development of the federated ML and analytics python framework, which is a crucial component of our SaaS product. We're tackling lots of really interesting problems at the intersection of AI, ML and Analytics workflows, privacy, security, and enterprise functionality (e.g. for healthcare) across a number of apps and use-cases. You'll be part of a strong cross-functional team (product, design, engineering).
You should be comfortable with high quality software practices (including code-reviews, testing practices, and software design), happy to work in a diverse team, be willing to participate in our team-led discussions, and generally be interested in making sure artificial intelligence and data are used to make the world a better place.
Your work will include:
Working with product managers, front-end and full-stack engineers to build and grow the python backend that powers our app and web products
Developing a flexible yet robust backend that allows users to build machine learning models and perform data analytics whilst preserving privacy
Contributing to the process of planning, scoping and fleshing out projects we tackle during our development cycles
Supporting customers where necessary, ensuring they’re able to use the platform effectively for their use-case
Helping to shape engineering standards, practices and culture at Bitfount
You may be fit for this role if you:
3+ years of relevant experience designing and building software applications at a tech-forward software company
Have an excellent working knowledge of Python
Either have some experience using PyTorch/TensorFlow for machine learning or using NumPy for general data science tasks
You either already have a solid understanding of machine learning theory and practical challenges around training and deploying machine learning models or are enthusiastic about working on a ML-driven product team and learning about these topics
Bonus points for experience with privacy, security
Bonus points for qualifications in machine learning
Can pick things up quickly and adapt
Have solid knowledge of python unit testing
Have experience developing and running build, test, and deployment tools in production environments
Strong communication skills to bridge the gap between design, product, and engineering

Society’s data superpowers are gathering dust due to a problem that is easy to describe but hard to solve: The data required to solve the world's most pressing problems isn't the kind that's easily shared.
The limitations of current data infrastructure have created painful, slow, expensive and often ineffective workarounds for what should be seamless collaborations between trusted partners. But it doesn't have to be this way. ‍So we're building a missing piece of global infrastructure: a secure network to enable organisations to send algorithms to data. This means they can share the benefits of their data with each other, without having to go through the painful and risky process of moving it around, without compromising its privacy, and without even needing to expose any raw data.
Right now, we’re heads-down on applying our platform to the problem of clinical trial recruitment in the Healthcare space. We’re enabling privacy-preserving collaboration between healthcare providers and pharmaceutical companies, which will remove a major friction point in the process, and help ensure critical medicines make it through trials and into the hands of those who need them much sooner.
We believe that great software is built by great people working in great teams, and we’re working hard to make Bitfount a home for both. We’re committed to building an organisation that people are proud to be part of, where everyone can learn and grow, where everyone is supported, and where everyone can do the best, most meaningful work of their careers in a cross-disciplinary environment. Everyone’s viewpoint is valued and we work hard to foster a culture of open discussion. We’re backed by top UK and international investors and a stellar advisory team.

You'll be part of a strong cross-functional team (product, design, engineering).
You should be comfortable with high quality software practices (including code-reviews, testing practices, and software design), happy to work in a diverse team, be willing to participate in our team-led discussions, and generally be interested in making sure artificial intelligence and data are used to make the world a better place.

Working with product managers, front-end and full-stack engineers to build and grow the python backend that powers our app and web products
Developing a flexible yet robust backend that allows users to build machine learning models and perform data analytics whilst preserving privacy
Contributing to the process of planning, scoping and fleshing out projects we tackle during our development cycles

Have an excellent working knowledge of Python
Either have some experience using PyTorch/TensorFlow for machine learning or using NumPy for general data science tasks

Can pick things up quickly and adapt
Have solid knowledge of python unit testing
Have experience developing and running build, test, and deployment tools in production environments

Why join us
We’re still a young startup (~50 employees, ~70% engineers) but we’re at an inflection point. Our software is running live and providing gains in a world class semiconductor factory and we will soon be scaling to many more. We are expecting to grow the engineering team several fold in the coming years so this is an extremely exciting time to join. If you’re not interested in writing yet another CRUD app and are looking for some unique challenges and complex problems to solve then this is the place for you.
We were recently voted one of the world’s most disruptive companies on the Disrupt 100 List and are well funded with the aim to take even more funding in the coming months to support our ambitious growth plan.

At our size, every developer is crucial and has a big impact on our final product.
Finally, we are having a big impact on the world. The factories we optimise create things that are all around us. They’re in the device you’re reading this on and countless other devices in your home. They’re used in healthcare, aviation, automotive, robotics, communications, IoT and many more and they’re in limited supply making our software even more vital to our customers who are under pressure to increase output. In short, there’s never been a better time to join Flexciton.

Society’s data superpowers are gathering dust due to a problem that is easy to describe but hard to solve: The data required to solve the world's most pressing problems isn't the kind that's easily shared.
The limitations of current data infrastructure have created painful, slow, expensive and often ineffective workarounds for what should be seamless collaborations between trusted partners. But it doesn't have to be this way. ‍So we're building a missing piece of global infrastructure: a secure network to enable organisations to send algorithms to data. This means they can share the benefits of their data with each other, without having to go through the painful and risky process of moving it around, without compromising its privacy, and without even needing to expose any raw data.
Right now, we’re heads-down on applying our platform to the problem of clinical trial recruitment in the Healthcare space. We’re enabling privacy-preserving collaboration between healthcare providers and pharmaceutical companies, which will remove a major friction point in the process, and help ensure critical medicines make it through trials and into the hands of those who need them much sooner.
We believe that great software is built by great people working in great teams, and we’re working hard to make Bitfount a home for both. We’re committed to building an organisation that people are proud to be part of, where everyone can learn and grow, where everyone is supported, and where everyone can do the best, most meaningful work of their careers in a cross-disciplinary environment. Everyone’s viewpoint is valued and we work hard to foster a culture of open discussion. We’re backed by top UK and international investors and a stellar advisory team.

Society’s data superpowers are gathering dust due to a problem that is easy to describe but hard to solve: The data required to solve the world's most pressing problems isn't the kind that's easily shared.
The limitations of current data infrastructure have created painful, slow, expensive and often ineffective workarounds for what should be seamless collaborations between trusted partners. But it doesn't have to be this way. ‍So we're building a missing piece of global infrastructure: a secure network to enable organisations to send algorithms to data. This means they can share the benefits of their data with each other, without having to go through the painful and risky process of moving it around, without compromising its privacy, and without even needing to expose any raw data.
Right now, we’re heads-down on applying our platform to the problem of clinical trial recruitment in the Healthcare space. We’re enabling privacy-preserving collaboration between healthcare providers and pharmaceutical companies, which will remove a major friction point in the process, and help ensure critical medicines make it through trials and into the hands of those who need them much sooner.
We believe that great software is built by great people working in great teams, and we’re working hard to make Bitfount a home for both. We’re committed to building an organisation that people are proud to be part of, where everyone can learn and grow, where everyone is supported, and where everyone can do the best, most meaningful work of their careers in a cross-disciplinary environment. Everyone’s viewpoint is valued and we work hard to foster a culture of open discussion. We’re backed by top UK and international investors and a stellar advisory team.

You'll be part of a strong cross-functional team (product, design, engineering).
You should be comfortable with high quality software practices (including code-reviews, testing practices, and software design), happy to work in a diverse team, be willing to participate in our team-led discussions, and generally be interested in making sure artificial intelligence and data are used to make the world a better place.

Working with product managers, front-end and full-stack engineers to build and grow the python backend that powers our app and web products
Developing a flexible yet robust backend that allows users to build machine learning models and perform data analytics whilst preserving privacy
Contributing to the process of planning, scoping and fleshing out projects we tackle during our development cycles
