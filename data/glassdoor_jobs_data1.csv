We work together to safeguard Britain’s people, interests and businesses from various threats at home, overseas and online. To do that, we rely on data. On our Intelligence Data Analyst Development Programmes in either agency you’ll see you don’t need to be a data expert to help protect the UK - just yourself. Our operations are hugely varied, which is why increasing the diversity of our people is needed more than ever before.
To protect the UK, we need people with different perspectives and backgrounds. There’s no one ‘type’ of person we recruit. You don’t need to have coding or programming skills, but you’ll have some experience analysing data and will be keen to develop your abilities further with our support and training. You’ll have (or be expecting) a 2:2 degree in any subject or have relevant work experience.
Relying on data, our Intelligence Analyst’s play a crucial role in keeping the country safe. It can be complex, but understanding it is key to the success of our operations. And if you think you know what sort of person works in data, think again. On our Intelligence and Data Analyst Development Programmes, you’ll see you don’t need to be a data expert to help protect the UK - just yourself.
We have opportunities available in either MI5 or MI6.
The programme at MI5 is based in London and begins with a 3-month training period, where you’ll learn more about the organisation and our processes. Then, you’ll do 3 different analyst postings right in the heart of MI5. Over the course of 5 years and beyond, you’ll develop your technical skills, work with tools that can’t be found anywhere else, and gain experience to support a fulfilling and rewarding career in analysis.
If you choose the programme at MI6, you’ll work for MI6 but be based in Cheltenham for the first two years before moving to London. You’ll join a multi-organisational analysis team, playing a vital role in turning raw data into intelligence to help keep our country safe. Your first six months on the programme will include a mixture of formal training in technical and analytical tools as well as on the job learning.
For more information, please visit the Intelligence and Data Analyst Development Programme on our website.
The application window for the Intelligence and Data Analyst Programme will open on 6th February 2023. In the meantime, we are looking for individuals who are from an Ethnic Minority background*, to register their interest in this forthcoming opportunity. As part of the registration of interest, you will be invited to an online event prior to the campaign opening.
Please note that a registration of interest does not constitute a job application, nor will such registration have any bearing upon the recruitment process itself. Any individuals who register their interest and who decide subsequently to apply to the Intelligence and Data Analyst Development Programmes, will need to complete an application form once the window for applications has opened.

We are confining registrations of interest to those from an Ethnic Minority background only, due to their current under-representation in our workforce.

This promise has been at the heart of our approach to hybrid working, ensuing a balance of time working in our offices, supporting the culture of collaboration and inclusion and some working time from home, so we can all continue to benefit from the flexibility this brings. Our hybrid working approach is built around our mutual mindset, thinking about what is good for us as individuals (the ‘me’) and in the context of what is right for our customers, our colleagues and The Royal London group (the ‘we’). Together we belong- collaborate – learn and perform.

Our expectation is that colleagues working in hybrid roles will come into the office for 50% of their time, and the rest from home. We want to be as consistent as we can with our approach but we also appreciate some colleagues need adjustments based on personal circumstances. (e.g. to support a disability, or caring responsibility) and / or may wish to formally seek a flexible working pattern in line with our flexible working policy.

We appreciate the world of work continues to evolve and we will continue to listen to our colleagues views on this whilst ensuring our on-going approach is right for our business and customers
We are an equal opportunities employer. We work hard to attract the best talent for our award-winning team. We believe that embracing difference makes us stronger. Our diverse people bring us different skills – whatever their educational background, disability, gender, age, sexual orientation, race, religion or belief.

innocent started with a simple mission: to make drinks that make it easy to do yourself some good. In 1999 we concocted a few smoothies in our kitchen and tested them on people at a music festival; today we’re blending every type of fruit & veg under the sun and selling drinks right across Europe. We have great ambitions: to show the world that you can build a successful business that cares about more than just profit, and to leave things better than we find them. We’re proud to call ourselves Europe’s favourite little healthy drinks company, but we’re still growing. And that means we need more brilliant people who share our ambition, to join in with the next, most exciting, part of our story.

innocent have undergone a large programme of work to transform the systems and processes that sit at the heart of our business and support the running of a brand new factory (the blender). Alongside this we’ve also created the brand new Data & Analytics team to leverage the power of the data these systems provide.

We are now looking for an accomplished Project Manager, reporting into the Data & Analytics lead, to support our project delivery and hit our long term roadmap. Success will mean our data, and the insights it can provide, becomes embedded into innocent’s culture, ultimately making it easy for our people to work smart.

From the initial ideas right through planning, building, testing, go-live, business handover and project closure, you’ll be making sure we hit our milestones, manage our risks and issues, navigate around unplanned changes and keep our stakeholders informed. And deliver great results that make everyone’s working lives that bit easier.

you'll have
Project Management experience
Experience or an interest of working on data / analytics projects
Understanding of and confidence using standard project methodology, process, and frameworks
Pride in your attention to detail, organisation, and proactivity
Strong stakeholder management and influencing ability across all levels of the business
Comfort with conflict, bringing people together to resolve issues and hold them to account
It would be ideal if you'd have:
Knowledge of Power BI and Microsoft D365

you'll get
An opportunity to join a brand new team (Data & Analytics) where you can have a real impact from the start, making the most of your skills and delivering real value across all areas of the business.

We’re relatively early in our data and analytics journey but this position will play a key role in developing our capabilities into new and exciting areas.

What’s more, you will be a part of the wider project management community with plenty of opportunities to learn and develop your career.

You will help us to keep doing business the right way – keeping innocent one of the Sunday Times Best Places to Work, using our B Corp status to inspire wider change, and reinforcing our culture of staying little as we grow big. At innocent, it’s the relationships and friendships we create while working together, that make us who we are. It’s why we love hybrid working – a mix of connecting in person and remotely. We’re also aware that the world is changing, and we all want and need different things from our work and home lives.

4.3",Graduate Internship - Data (6 month FTC),"London, England",£26K - £70K (Employer Est.),-1,1 to 50 Employees,2018,Company - Private,Research & Development,Management & Consulting,Unknown / Non-Applicable,4.3,3.8,4.0,3.9,4.0,"Company Description

We’re a London-based fintech startup who have just raised a $3.5mn seed round. Our seed round was led by Lakestar, who previously invested in Revolut, Spotify, and Facebook. In 2020 we were named Financial Technology Innovation of the Year and Tech Nation Rising Star. Our mission is to help you retire with a larger pension.
Most adults in the UK hold their pension in a pension fund. Pension funds give the money in your pension pot to asset managers so that asset managers can invest the money and, hopefully, increase the value of your pension over time. In return for managing the fund, asset managers charge fees.
Most pension funds have poor understanding of the fees they are paying, often being overcharged. As a result, by the time you retire as much as 40% of your pension has been paid to asset managers in the form of fees.
ClearGlass is a digital platform which allows pension funds to discover, analyse, and compare the fees that asset managers are charging them. Pension funds can then use this data to negotiate better deals, reduce costs, and allow us all to retire with larger pensions.
As of June 2021, ClearGlass has helped more than 800 pension funds & asset owners, with a combined value of over 700 billion pounds, to see their fees. We also work with pension funds in Europe and southern Africa.
We’ve raised our seed round with some of Europe’s leading VCs. We have the support of UK government bodies, and some of the biggest players in the pension industry.

We work together to safeguard Britain’s people, interests and businesses from various threats at home, overseas and online. To do that, we rely on data. On our Intelligence Data Analyst Development Programmes in either agency you’ll see you don’t need to be a data expert to help protect the UK - just yourself. Our operations are hugely varied, which is why increasing the diversity of our people is needed more than ever before.
To protect the UK, we need people with different perspectives and backgrounds. There’s no one ‘type’ of person we recruit. You don’t need to have coding or programming skills, but you’ll have some experience analysing data and will be keen to develop your abilities further with our support and training. You’ll have (or be expecting) a 2:2 degree in any subject or have relevant work experience.
Relying on data, our Intelligence Analyst’s play a crucial role in keeping the country safe. It can be complex, but understanding it is key to the success of our operations. And if you think you know what sort of person works in data, think again. On our Intelligence and Data Analyst Development Programmes, you’ll see you don’t need to be a data expert to help protect the UK - just yourself.
We have opportunities available in either MI5 or MI6.
The programme at MI5 is based in London and begins with a 3-month training period, where you’ll learn more about the organisation and our processes. Then, you’ll do 3 different analyst postings right in the heart of MI5. Over the course of 5 years and beyond, you’ll develop your technical skills, work with tools that can’t be found anywhere else, and gain experience to support a fulfilling and rewarding career in analysis.
If you choose the programme at MI6, you’ll work for MI6 but be based in Cheltenham for the first two years before moving to London. You’ll join a multi-organisational analysis team, playing a vital role in turning raw data into intelligence to help keep our country safe. Your first six months on the programme will include a mixture of formal training in technical and analytical tools as well as on the job learning.
For more information, please visit the Intelligence and Data Analyst Development Programme on our website.
The application window for the Intelligence and Data Analyst Programme will open on 6th February 2023. In the meantime, we are looking for individuals who are from an Ethnic Minority background*, to register their interest in this forthcoming opportunity. As part of the registration of interest, you will be invited to an online event prior to the campaign opening.
Please note that a registration of interest does not constitute a job application, nor will such registration have any bearing upon the recruitment process itself. Any individuals who register their interest and who decide subsequently to apply to the Intelligence and Data Analyst Development Programmes, will need to complete an application form once the window for applications has opened.

We are confining registrations of interest to those from an Ethnic Minority background only, due to their current under-representation in our workforce. Once the application window has opened, we will welcome applications from all candidates, regardless of their ethnic background, gender, disability and/or any other characteristic(s).

We work together to safeguard Britain’s people, interests and businesses from various threats at home, overseas and online. To do that, we rely on data. On our Intelligence Data Analyst Development Programmes in either agency you’ll see you don’t need to be a data expert to help protect the UK - just yourself. Our operations are hugely varied, which is why increasing the diversity of our people is needed more than ever before.
To protect the UK, we need people with different perspectives and backgrounds. There’s no one ‘type’ of person we recruit. You don’t need to have coding or programming skills, but you’ll have some experience analysing data and will be keen to develop your abilities further with our support and training. You’ll have (or be expecting) a 2:2 degree in any subject or have relevant work experience.
Relying on data, our Intelligence Analyst’s play a crucial role in keeping the country safe. It can be complex, but understanding it is key to the success of our operations. And if you think you know what sort of person works in data, think again. On our Intelligence and Data Analyst Development Programmes, you’ll see you don’t need to be a data expert to help protect the UK - just yourself.
We have opportunities available in either MI5 or MI6.
The programme at MI5 is based in London and begins with a 3-month training period, where you’ll learn more about the organisation and our processes. Then, you’ll do 3 different analyst postings right in the heart of MI5. Over the course of 5 years and beyond, you’ll develop your technical skills, work with tools that can’t be found anywhere else, and gain experience to support a fulfilling and rewarding career in analysis.
If you choose the programme at MI6, you’ll work for MI6 but be based in Cheltenham for the first two years before moving to London. You’ll join a multi-organisational analysis team, playing a vital role in turning raw data into intelligence to help keep our country safe. Your first six months on the programme will include a mixture of formal training in technical and analytical tools as well as on the job learning.
For more information, please visit the Intelligence and Data Analyst Development Programme on our website.
The application window for the Intelligence and Data Analyst Programme will open on 6th February 2023. In the meantime, we are looking for individuals who are from an Ethnic Minority background*, to register their interest in this forthcoming opportunity. As part of the registration of interest, you will be invited to an online event prior to the campaign opening.
Please note that a registration of interest does not constitute a job application, nor will such registration have any bearing upon the recruitment process itself. Any individuals who register their interest and who decide subsequently to apply to the Intelligence and Data Analyst Development Programmes, will need to complete an application form once the window for applications has opened.

We are confining registrations of interest to those from an Ethnic Minority background only, due to their current under-representation in our workforce. Once the application window has opened, we will welcome applications from all candidates, regardless of their ethnic background, gender, disability and/or any other characteristic(s). All applications will be assessed solely on merit.

We work together to safeguard Britain’s people, interests and businesses from various threats at home, overseas and online. To do that, we rely on data. On our Intelligence Data Analyst Development Programmes in either agency you’ll see you don’t need to be a data expert to help protect the UK - just yourself. Our operations are hugely varied, which is why increasing the diversity of our people is needed more than ever before.
To protect the UK, we need people with different perspectives and backgrounds. There’s no one ‘type’ of person we recruit. You don’t need to have coding or programming skills, but you’ll have some experience analysing data and will be keen to develop your abilities further with our support and training. You’ll have (or be expecting) a 2:2 degree in any subject or have relevant work experience.
Relying on data, our Intelligence Analyst’s play a crucial role in keeping the country safe. It can be complex, but understanding it is key to the success of our operations. And if you think you know what sort of person works in data, think again. On our Intelligence and Data Analyst Development Programmes, you’ll see you don’t need to be a data expert to help protect the UK - just yourself.
We have opportunities available in either MI5 or MI6.
The programme at MI5 is based in London and begins with a 3-month training period, where you’ll learn more about the organisation and our processes. Then, you’ll do 3 different analyst postings right in the heart of MI5. Over the course of 5 years and beyond, you’ll develop your technical skills, work with tools that can’t be found anywhere else, and gain experience to support a fulfilling and rewarding career in analysis.
If you choose the programme at MI6, you’ll work for MI6 but be based in Cheltenham for the first two years before moving to London. You’ll join a multi-organisational analysis team, playing a vital role in turning raw data into intelligence to help keep our country safe. Your first six months on the programme will include a mixture of formal training in technical and analytical tools as well as on the job learning.
For more information, please visit the Intelligence and Data Analyst Development Programme on our website.
The application window for the Intelligence and Data Analyst Programme will open on 6th February 2023. In the meantime, we are looking for individuals who are from an Ethnic Minority background*, to register their interest in this forthcoming opportunity. As part of the registration of interest, you will be invited to an online event prior to the campaign opening.
Please note that a registration of interest does not constitute a job application, nor will such registration have any bearing upon the recruitment process itself. Any individuals who register their interest and who decide subsequently to apply to the Intelligence and Data Analyst Development Programmes, will need to complete an application form once the window for applications has opened.

We are confining registrations of interest to those from an Ethnic Minority background only, due to their current under-representation in our workforce. Once the application window has opened, we will welcome applications from all candidates, regardless of their ethnic background, gender, disability and/or any other characteristic(s). All applications will be assessed solely on merit.

Do great green things with OVO Energy!
So much has changed since we launched in 2009. Our goal remains the same though: make energy cheaper, greener, and simpler. Just as it was on day one.

Helping our Leadership team prioritise how we integrate our Group companies and rationalise our organisational and technical architectures.

Designing, building and maintaining a cutting edge Data Platform based on streaming technologies.
Developing tooling that helps other parts of the business use the Data Platform, including tools that help users find and access the data they need, understand the lineage of data, as well as developing self-serve tooling that helps users to publish to and consume from the platform.
Working in an agile software engineering team where you will have the opportunity to Influence technology selection.
Helping to establish good engineering processes within the team including: using infrastructure as code; contributing to automated testing efforts; utilising monitoring and alerting tools; and employing CI/CD best practices to deploy regularly to production.

We work together to safeguard Britain’s people, interests and businesses from various threats at home, overseas and online. To do that, we rely on data. On our Intelligence Data Analyst Development Programmes in either agency you’ll see you don’t need to be a data expert to help protect the UK - just yourself. Our operations are hugely varied, which is why increasing the diversity of our people is needed more than ever before.
To protect the UK, we need people with different perspectives and backgrounds. There’s no one ‘type’ of person we recruit. You don’t need to have coding or programming skills, but you’ll have some experience analysing data and will be keen to develop your abilities further with our support and training. You’ll have (or be expecting) a 2:2 degree in any subject or have relevant work experience.
Relying on data, our Intelligence Analyst’s play a crucial role in keeping the country safe. It can be complex, but understanding it is key to the success of our operations. And if you think you know what sort of person works in data, think again. On our Intelligence and Data Analyst Development Programmes, you’ll see you don’t need to be a data expert to help protect the UK - just yourself.
We have opportunities available in either MI5 or MI6.
The programme at MI5 is based in London and begins with a 3-month training period, where you’ll learn more about the organisation and our processes. Then, you’ll do 3 different analyst postings right in the heart of MI5. Over the course of 5 years and beyond, you’ll develop your technical skills, work with tools that can’t be found anywhere else, and gain experience to support a fulfilling and rewarding career in analysis.
If you choose the programme at MI6, you’ll work for MI6 but be based in Cheltenham for the first two years before moving to London. You’ll join a multi-organisational analysis team, playing a vital role in turning raw data into intelligence to help keep our country safe. Your first six months on the programme will include a mixture of formal training in technical and analytical tools as well as on the job learning.
For more information, please visit the Intelligence and Data Analyst Development Programme on our website.
The application window for the Intelligence and Data Analyst Programme will open on 6th February 2023. In the meantime, we are looking for individuals who are from an Ethnic Minority background*, to register their interest in this forthcoming opportunity. As part of the registration of interest, you will be invited to an online event prior to the campaign opening.
Please note that a registration of interest does not constitute a job application, nor will such registration have any bearing upon the recruitment process itself. Any individuals who register their interest and who decide subsequently to apply to the Intelligence and Data Analyst Development Programmes, will need to complete an application form once the window for applications has opened.

We are confining registrations of interest to those from an Ethnic Minority background only, due to their current under-representation in our workforce.

Developing tooling that helps other parts of the business use the Data Platform, including tools that help users find and access the data they need, understand the lineage of data, as well as developing self-serve tooling that helps users to publish to and consume from the platform.
Working in an agile software engineering team where you will have the opportunity to Influence technology selection.
Helping to establish good engineering processes within the team including: using infrastructure as code; contributing to automated testing efforts; utilising monitoring and alerting tools; and employing CI/CD best practices to deploy regularly to production.

We work together to safeguard Britain’s people, interests and businesses from various threats at home, overseas and online. To do that, we rely on data. On our Intelligence Data Analyst Development Programmes in either agency you’ll see you don’t need to be a data expert to help protect the UK - just yourself. Our operations are hugely varied, which is why increasing the diversity of our people is needed more than ever before.
To protect the UK, we need people with different perspectives and backgrounds. There’s no one ‘type’ of person we recruit. You don’t need to have coding or programming skills, but you’ll have some experience analysing data and will be keen to develop your abilities further with our support and training. You’ll have (or be expecting) a 2:2 degree in any subject or have relevant work experience.
Relying on data, our Intelligence Analyst’s play a crucial role in keeping the country safe. It can be complex, but understanding it is key to the success of our operations. And if you think you know what sort of person works in data, think again. On our Intelligence and Data Analyst Development Programmes, you’ll see you don’t need to be a data expert to help protect the UK - just yourself.
We have opportunities available in either MI5 or MI6.
The programme at MI5 is based in London and begins with a 3-month training period, where you’ll learn more about the organisation and our processes. Then, you’ll do 3 different analyst postings right in the heart of MI5. Over the course of 5 years and beyond, you’ll develop your technical skills, work with tools that can’t be found anywhere else, and gain experience to support a fulfilling and rewarding career in analysis.
If you choose the programme at MI6, you’ll work for MI6 but be based in Cheltenham for the first two years before moving to London. You’ll join a multi-organisational analysis team, playing a vital role in turning raw data into intelligence to help keep our country safe. Your first six months on the programme will include a mixture of formal training in technical and analytical tools as well as on the job learning.
For more information, please visit the Intelligence and Data Analyst Development Programme on our website.
The application window for the Intelligence and Data Analyst Programme will open on 6th February 2023. In the meantime, we are looking for individuals who are from an Ethnic Minority background*, to register their interest in this forthcoming opportunity. As part of the registration of interest, you will be invited to an online event prior to the campaign opening.

Developing tooling that helps other parts of the business use the Data Platform, including tools that help users find and access the data they need, understand the lineage of data, as well as developing self-serve tooling that helps users to publish to and consume from the platform.

Helping to establish good engineering processes within the team including: using infrastructure as code; contributing to automated testing efforts; utilising monitoring and alerting tools; and employing CI/CD best practices to deploy regularly to production.

We work together to safeguard Britain’s people, interests and businesses from various threats at home, overseas and online. To do that, we rely on data. On our Intelligence Data Analyst Development Programmes in either agency you’ll see you don’t need to be a data expert to help protect the UK - just yourself. Our operations are hugely varied, which is why increasing the diversity of our people is needed more than ever before.
To protect the UK, we need people with different perspectives and backgrounds. There’s no one ‘type’ of person we recruit. You don’t need to have coding or programming skills, but you’ll have some experience analysing data and will be keen to develop your abilities further with our support and training. You’ll have (or be expecting) a 2:2 degree in any subject or have relevant work experience.
Relying on data, our Intelligence Analyst’s play a crucial role in keeping the country safe. It can be complex, but understanding it is key to the success of our operations. And if you think you know what sort of person works in data, think again. On our Intelligence and Data Analyst Development Programmes, you’ll see you don’t need to be a data expert to help protect the UK - just yourself.
We have opportunities available in either MI5 or MI6.
The programme at MI5 is based in London and begins with a 3-month training period, where you’ll learn more about the organisation and our processes. Then, you’ll do 3 different analyst postings right in the heart of MI5. Over the course of 5 years and beyond, you’ll develop your technical skills, work with tools that can’t be found anywhere else, and gain experience to support a fulfilling and rewarding career in analysis.
If you choose the programme at MI6, you’ll work for MI6 but be based in Cheltenham for the first two years before moving to London. You’ll join a multi-organisational analysis team, playing a vital role in turning raw data into intelligence to help keep our country safe. Your first six months on the programme will include a mixture of formal training in technical and analytical tools as well as on the job learning.
For more information, please visit the Intelligence and Data Analyst Development Programme on our website.
The application window for the Intelligence and Data Analyst Programme will open on 6th February 2023. In the meantime, we are looking for individuals who are from an Ethnic Minority background*, to register their interest in this forthcoming opportunity. As part of the registration of interest, you will be invited to an online event prior to the campaign opening.
Please note that a registration of interest does not constitute a job application, nor will such registration have any bearing upon the recruitment process itself. Any individuals who register their interest and who decide subsequently to apply to the Intelligence and Data Analyst Development Programmes, will need to complete an application form once the window for applications has opened.

We are confining registrations of interest to those from an Ethnic Minority background only, due to their current under-representation in our workforce. Once the application window has opened, we will welcome applications from all candidates, regardless of their ethnic background, gender, disability and/or any other characteristic(s). All applications will be assessed solely on merit.

We work together to safeguard Britain’s people, interests and businesses from various threats at home, overseas and online. To do that, we rely on data. On our Intelligence Data Analyst Development Programmes in either agency you’ll see you don’t need to be a data expert to help protect the UK - just yourself. Our operations are hugely varied, which is why increasing the diversity of our people is needed more than ever before.
To protect the UK, we need people with different perspectives and backgrounds. There’s no one ‘type’ of person we recruit. You don’t need to have coding or programming skills, but you’ll have some experience analysing data and will be keen to develop your abilities further with our support and training. You’ll have (or be expecting) a 2:2 degree in any subject or have relevant work experience.
Relying on data, our Intelligence Analyst’s play a crucial role in keeping the country safe. It can be complex, but understanding it is key to the success of our operations. And if you think you know what sort of person works in data, think again. On our Intelligence and Data Analyst Development Programmes, you’ll see you don’t need to be a data expert to help protect the UK - just yourself.
We have opportunities available in either MI5 or MI6.
The programme at MI5 is based in London and begins with a 3-month training period, where you’ll learn more about the organisation and our processes. Then, you’ll do 3 different analyst postings right in the heart of MI5. Over the course of 5 years and beyond, you’ll develop your technical skills, work with tools that can’t be found anywhere else, and gain experience to support a fulfilling and rewarding career in analysis.
If you choose the programme at MI6, you’ll work for MI6 but be based in Cheltenham for the first two years before moving to London. You’ll join a multi-organisational analysis team, playing a vital role in turning raw data into intelligence to help keep our country safe. Your first six months on the programme will include a mixture of formal training in technical and analytical tools as well as on the job learning.
For more information, please visit the Intelligence and Data Analyst Development Programme on our website.
The application window for the Intelligence and Data Analyst Programme will open on 6th February 2023. In the meantime, we are looking for individuals who are from an Ethnic Minority background*, to register their interest in this forthcoming opportunity. As part of the registration of interest, you will be invited to an online event prior to the campaign opening.
Please note that a registration of interest does not constitute a job application, nor will such registration have any bearing upon the recruitment process itself. Any individuals who register their interest and who decide subsequently to apply to the Intelligence and Data Analyst Development Programmes, will need to complete an application form once the window for applications has opened.

We are confining registrations of interest to those from an Ethnic Minority background only, due to their current under-representation in our workforce. Once the application window has opened, we will welcome applications from all candidates, regardless of their ethnic background, gender, disability and/or any other characteristic(s). All applications will be assessed solely on merit.

We’re OVO Group, a big family of companies united by a single vision: to get to zero carbon, fast.
We call this Plan Zero – and it shows how we’ll be fighting the climate crisis and transforming the way people use energy over the next decade. To do this, we need the sharpest minds. Are you up for the challenge?
Do great green things with OVO Energy!
So much has changed since we launched in 2009. Our goal remains the same though: make energy cheaper, greener, and simpler. Just as it was on day one.
Everyone belongs at OVO

Our aim is to build a diverse and inclusive movement: teams of brilliant people, with unique talents, skills, passions, and experiences. We encourage everyone to join us, whatever your gender identity, race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, age, life experience, or background. So please come as you are – we can’t wait to meet you.
Where in the world of OVO will I be working?

Enabling our product teams to work out the best way to serve our members in a highly regulated and competitive market;
Allowing our Data Science teams to build tools and models to help members reduce their carbon impact by analysing their 10 second smart meter data;
Helping our Leadership team prioritise how we integrate our Group companies and rationalise our organisational and technical architectures.
To support these use cases, and many more, we need to be able to empower the organisation with a cutting edge Data Platform. You will work as part of a growing set of teams focused on building this platform, providing the rest of the business with the tools, services and data they need, at the speed they need it.
What will I be doing?
Key responsibilities include:
Designing, building and maintaining a cutting edge Data Platform based on streaming technologies.
Developing tooling that helps other parts of the business use the Data Platform, including tools that help users find and access the data they need, understand the lineage of data, as well as developing self-serve tooling that helps users to publish to and consume from the platform.
Working in an agile software engineering team where you will have the opportunity to Influence technology selection.
Helping to establish good engineering processes within the team including: using infrastructure as code; contributing to automated testing efforts; utilising monitoring and alerting tools; and employing CI/CD best practices to deploy regularly to production.
Is this job for me?

Ideally you will have:

Experience working on streaming ETL solutions utilising streaming data processing tools (e.g. Kafka Streams, Amazon Kinesis or similar)
Proven ability to assist in the design, technology selection, implementation and testing of software
Excellent knowledge of programming languages e.g. Scala, Python, Java and/or SQL
Experience developing cloud-based solutions on GCP, AWS or Azure using Infrastructure as code tools such as Terraform
A proven track record of designing, building, monitoring and managing large-scale data products, pipelines, tooling and platforms
A solid knowledge of data engineering principles such as Data Modelling, Data Warehouses, Data Lakes, Data Marts and ETL

You’ll have (or be expecting) a 2:2 degree in any subject or have relevant work experience.
Relying on data, our Intelligence Analyst’s play a crucial role in keeping the country safe. It can be complex, but understanding it is key to the success of our operations. And if you think you know what sort of person works in data, think again. On our Intelligence and Data Analyst Development Programmes, you’ll see you don’t need to be a data expert to help protect the UK - just yourself.
We have opportunities available in either MI5 or MI6.
The programme at MI5 is based in London and begins with a 3-month training period, where you’ll learn more about the organisation and our processes. Then, you’ll do 3 different analyst postings right in the heart of MI5. Over the course of 5 years and beyond, you’ll develop your technical skills, work with tools that can’t be found anywhere else, and gain experience to support a fulfilling and rewarding career in analysis.
If you choose the programme at MI6, you’ll work for MI6 but be based in Cheltenham for the first two years before moving to London. You’ll join a multi-organisational analysis team, playing a vital role in turning raw data into intelligence to help keep our country safe. Your first six months on the programme will include a mixture of formal training in technical and analytical tools as well as on the job learning.
For more information, please visit the Intelligence and Data Analyst Development Programme on our website.
The application window for the Intelligence and Data Analyst Programme will open on 6th February 2023. In the meantime, we are looking for individuals who are from an Ethnic Minority background*, to register their interest in this forthcoming opportunity. As part of the registration of interest, you will be invited to an online event prior to the campaign opening.
Please note that a registration of interest does not constitute a job application, nor will such registration have any bearing upon the recruitment process itself. Any individuals who register their interest and who decide subsequently to apply to the Intelligence and Data Analyst Development Programmes, will need to complete an application form once the window for applications has opened.

We are confining registrations of interest to those from an Ethnic Minority background only, due to their current under-representation in our workforce. Once the application window has opened, we will welcome applications from all candidates, regardless of their ethnic background, gender, disability and/or any other characteristic(s). All applications will be assessed solely on merit.

We work together to safeguard Britain’s people, interests and businesses from various threats at home, overseas and online. To do that, we rely on data. On our Intelligence Data Analyst Development Programmes in either agency you’ll see you don’t need to be a data expert to help protect the UK - just yourself. Our operations are hugely varied, which is why increasing the diversity of our people is needed more than ever before.
To protect the UK, we need people with different perspectives and backgrounds. There’s no one ‘type’ of person we recruit. You don’t need to have coding or programming skills, but you’ll have some experience analysing data and will be keen to develop your abilities further with our support and training. You’ll have (or be expecting) a 2:2 degree in any subject or have relevant work experience.
Relying on data, our Intelligence Analyst’s play a crucial role in keeping the country safe. It can be complex, but understanding it is key to the success of our operations. And if you think you know what sort of person works in data, think again. On our Intelligence and Data Analyst Development Programmes, you’ll see you don’t need to be a data expert to help protect the UK - just yourself.
We have opportunities available in either MI5 or MI6.
The programme at MI5 is based in London and begins with a 3-month training period, where you’ll learn more about the organisation and our processes. Then, you’ll do 3 different analyst postings right in the heart of MI5. Over the course of 5 years and beyond, you’ll develop your technical skills, work with tools that can’t be found anywhere else, and gain experience to support a fulfilling and rewarding career in analysis.
If you choose the programme at MI6, you’ll work for MI6 but be based in Cheltenham for the first two years before moving to London. You’ll join a multi-organisational analysis team, playing a vital role in turning raw data into intelligence to help keep our country safe. Your first six months on the programme will include a mixture of formal training in technical and analytical tools as well as on the job learning.
For more information, please visit the Intelligence and Data Analyst Development Programme on our website.
The application window for the Intelligence and Data Analyst Programme will open on 6th February 2023. In the meantime, we are looking for individuals who are from an Ethnic Minority background*, to register their interest in this forthcoming opportunity. As part of the registration of interest, you will be invited to an online event prior to the campaign opening.
Please note that a registration of interest does not constitute a job application, nor will such registration have any bearing upon the recruitment process itself. Any individuals who register their interest and who decide subsequently to apply to the Intelligence and Data Analyst Development Programmes, will need to complete an application form once the window for applications has opened.

We are confining registrations of interest to those from an Ethnic Minority background only, due to their current under-representation in our workforce. Once the application window has opened, we will welcome applications from all candidates, regardless of their ethnic background, gender, disability and/or any other characteristic(s). All applications will be assessed solely on merit.

We call this Plan Zero – and it shows how we’ll be fighting the climate crisis and transforming the way people use energy over the next decade. To do this, we need the sharpest minds. Are you up for the challenge?
Do great green things with OVO Energy!
So much has changed since we launched in 2009. Our goal remains the same though: make energy cheaper, greener, and simpler. Just as it was on day one.
Everyone belongs at OVO

Our aim is to build a diverse and inclusive movement: teams of brilliant people, with unique talents, skills, passions, and experiences. We encourage everyone to join us, whatever your gender identity, race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, age, life experience, or background. So please come as you are – we can’t wait to meet you.
Where in the world of OVO will I be working?
OVO is a highly data-driven organisation, with an ever growing demand for excellent quality, reliable and accurate data to power decision making in various parts of the business, for example:

Allowing our Data Science teams to build tools and models to help members reduce their carbon impact by analysing their 10 second smart meter data;
Helping our Leadership team prioritise how we integrate our Group companies and rationalise our organisational and technical architectures.
To support these use cases, and many more, we need to be able to empower the organisation with a cutting edge Data Platform. You will work as part of a growing set of teams focused on building this platform, providing the rest of the business with the tools, services and data they need, at the speed they need it.
What will I be doing?
Key responsibilities include:
Designing, building and maintaining a cutting edge Data Platform based on streaming technologies.
Developing tooling that helps other parts of the business use the Data Platform, including tools that help users find and access the data they need, understand the lineage of data, as well as developing self-serve tooling that helps users to publish to and consume from the platform.
Working in an agile software engineering team where you will have the opportunity to Influence technology selection.
Helping to establish good engineering processes within the team including: using infrastructure as code; contributing to automated testing efforts; utilising monitoring and alerting tools; and employing CI/CD best practices to deploy regularly to production.
Is this job for me?

Ideally you will have:

Experience working on streaming ETL solutions utilising streaming data processing tools (e.g. Kafka Streams, Amazon Kinesis or similar)
Proven ability to assist in the design, technology selection, implementation and testing of software
Excellent knowledge of programming languages e.g. Scala, Python, Java and/or SQL
Experience developing cloud-based solutions on GCP, AWS or Azure using Infrastructure as code tools such as Terraform
A proven track record of designing, building, monitoring and managing large-scale data products, pipelines, tooling and platforms
A solid knowledge of data engineering principles such as Data Modelling, Data Warehouses, Data Lakes, Data Marts and ETL

We work together to safeguard Britain’s people, interests and businesses from various threats at home, overseas and online. To do that, we rely on data. On our Intelligence Data Analyst Development Programmes in either agency you’ll see you don’t need to be a data expert to help protect the UK - just yourself. Our operations are hugely varied, which is why increasing the diversity of our people is needed more than ever before.
To protect the UK, we need people with different perspectives and backgrounds. There’s no one ‘type’ of person we recruit. You don’t need to have coding or programming skills, but you’ll have some experience analysing data and will be keen to develop your abilities further with our support and training. You’ll have (or be expecting) a 2:2 degree in any subject or have relevant work experience.
Relying on data, our Intelligence Analyst’s play a crucial role in keeping the country safe. It can be complex, but understanding it is key to the success of our operations. And if you think you know what sort of person works in data, think again. On our Intelligence and Data Analyst Development Programmes, you’ll see you don’t need to be a data expert to help protect the UK - just yourself.
We have opportunities available in either MI5 or MI6.
The programme at MI5 is based in London and begins with a 3-month training period, where you’ll learn more about the organisation and our processes. Then, you’ll do 3 different analyst postings right in the heart of MI5. Over the course of 5 years and beyond, you’ll develop your technical skills, work with tools that can’t be found anywhere else, and gain experience to support a fulfilling and rewarding career in analysis.
If you choose the programme at MI6, you’ll work for MI6 but be based in Cheltenham for the first two years before moving to London. You’ll join a multi-organisational analysis team, playing a vital role in turning raw data into intelligence to help keep our country safe. Your first six months on the programme will include a mixture of formal training in technical and analytical tools as well as on the job learning.
For more information, please visit the Intelligence and Data Analyst Development Programme on our website.
The application window for the Intelligence and Data Analyst Programme will open on 6th February 2023. In the meantime, we are looking for individuals who are from an Ethnic Minority background*, to register their interest in this forthcoming opportunity. As part of the registration of interest, you will be invited to an online event prior to the campaign opening.
Please note that a registration of interest does not constitute a job application, nor will such registration have any bearing upon the recruitment process itself. Any individuals who register their interest and who decide subsequently to apply to the Intelligence and Data Analyst Development Programmes, will need to complete an application form once the window for applications has opened.

We are confining registrations of interest to those from an Ethnic Minority background only, due to their current under-representation in our workforce. Once the application window has opened, we will welcome applications from all candidates, regardless of their ethnic background, gender, disability and/or any other characteristic(s). All applications will be assessed solely on merit.

We work together to safeguard Britain’s people, interests and businesses from various threats at home, overseas and online. To do that, we rely on data. On our Intelligence Data Analyst Development Programmes in either agency you’ll see you don’t need to be a data expert to help protect the UK - just yourself. Our operations are hugely varied, which is why increasing the diversity of our people is needed more than ever before.
To protect the UK, we need people with different perspectives and backgrounds. There’s no one ‘type’ of person we recruit. You don’t need to have coding or programming skills, but you’ll have some experience analysing data and will be keen to develop your abilities further with our support and training. You’ll have (or be expecting) a 2:2 degree in any subject or have relevant work experience.
Relying on data, our Intelligence Analyst’s play a crucial role in keeping the country safe. It can be complex, but understanding it is key to the success of our operations. And if you think you know what sort of person works in data, think again. On our Intelligence and Data Analyst Development Programmes, you’ll see you don’t need to be a data expert to help protect the UK - just yourself.
We have opportunities available in either MI5 or MI6.
The programme at MI5 is based in London and begins with a 3-month training period, where you’ll learn more about the organisation and our processes. Then, you’ll do 3 different analyst postings right in the heart of MI5. Over the course of 5 years and beyond, you’ll develop your technical skills, work with tools that can’t be found anywhere else, and gain experience to support a fulfilling and rewarding career in analysis.
If you choose the programme at MI6, you’ll work for MI6 but be based in Cheltenham for the first two years before moving to London. You’ll join a multi-organisational analysis team, playing a vital role in turning raw data into intelligence to help keep our country safe. Your first six months on the programme will include a mixture of formal training in technical and analytical tools as well as on the job learning.
For more information, please visit the Intelligence and Data Analyst Development Programme on our website.
The application window for the Intelligence and Data Analyst Programme will open on 6th February 2023. In the meantime, we are looking for individuals who are from an Ethnic Minority background*, to register their interest in this forthcoming opportunity. As part of the registration of interest, you will be invited to an online event prior to the campaign opening.
Please note that a registration of interest does not constitute a job application, nor will such registration have any bearing upon the recruitment process itself. Any individuals who register their interest and who decide subsequently to apply to the Intelligence and Data Analyst Development Programmes, will need to complete an application form once the window for applications has opened.

We are confining registrations of interest to those from an Ethnic Minority background only, due to their current under-representation in our workforce. Once the application window has opened, we will welcome applications from all candidates, regardless of their ethnic background, gender, disability and/or any other characteristic(s). All applications will be assessed solely on merit.

We call this Plan Zero – and it shows how we’ll be fighting the climate crisis and transforming the way people use energy over the next decade. To do this, we need the sharpest minds. Are you up for the challenge?
Do great green things with OVO Energy!
So much has changed since we launched in 2009. Our goal remains the same though: make energy cheaper, greener, and simpler. Just as it was on day one.

Helping to establish good engineering processes within the team including: using infrastructure as code; contributing to automated testing efforts; utilising monitoring and alerting tools; and employing CI/CD best practices to deploy regularly to production.

We work together to safeguard Britain’s people, interests and businesses from various threats at home, overseas and online. To do that, we rely on data. On our Intelligence Data Analyst Development Programmes in either agency you’ll see you don’t need to be a data expert to help protect the UK - just yourself. Our operations are hugely varied, which is why increasing the diversity of our people is needed more than ever before.
To protect the UK, we need people with different perspectives and backgrounds. There’s no one ‘type’ of person we recruit. You don’t need to have coding or programming skills, but you’ll have some experience analysing data and will be keen to develop your abilities further with our support and training. You’ll have (or be expecting) a 2:2 degree in any subject or have relevant work experience.
Relying on data, our Intelligence Analyst’s play a crucial role in keeping the country safe. It can be complex, but understanding it is key to the success of our operations. And if you think you know what sort of person works in data, think again. On our Intelligence and Data Analyst Development Programmes, you’ll see you don’t need to be a data expert to help protect the UK - just yourself.
We have opportunities available in either MI5 or MI6.
The programme at MI5 is based in London and begins with a 3-month training period, where you’ll learn more about the organisation and our processes. Then, you’ll do 3 different analyst postings right in the heart of MI5. Over the course of 5 years and beyond, you’ll develop your technical skills, work with tools that can’t be found anywhere else, and gain experience to support a fulfilling and rewarding career in analysis.
If you choose the programme at MI6, you’ll work for MI6 but be based in Cheltenham for the first two years before moving to London. You’ll join a multi-organisational analysis team, playing a vital role in turning raw data into intelligence to help keep our country safe. Your first six months on the programme will include a mixture of formal training in technical and analytical tools as well as on the job learning.
For more information, please visit the Intelligence and Data Analyst Development Programme on our website.
The application window for the Intelligence and Data Analyst Programme will open on 6th February 2023. In the meantime, we are looking for individuals who are from an Ethnic Minority background*, to register their interest in this forthcoming opportunity. As part of the registration of interest, you will be invited to an online event prior to the campaign opening.
Please note that a registration of interest does not constitute a job application, nor will such registration have any bearing upon the recruitment process itself. Any individuals who register their interest and who decide subsequently to apply to the Intelligence and Data Analyst Development Programmes, will need to complete an application form once the window for applications has opened.

We are confining registrations of interest to those from an Ethnic Minority background only, due to their current under-representation in our workforce. Once the application window has opened, we will welcome applications from all candidates, regardless of their ethnic background, gender, disability and/or any other characteristic(s). All applications will be assessed solely on merit.

We call this Plan Zero – and it shows how we’ll be fighting the climate crisis and transforming the way people use energy over the next decade. To do this, we need the sharpest minds. Are you up for the challenge?
Do great green things with OVO Energy!
So much has changed since we launched in 2009. Our goal remains the same though: make energy cheaper, greener, and simpler. Just as it was on day one.

Helping our Leadership team prioritise how we integrate our Group companies and rationalise our organisational and technical architectures.

Developing tooling that helps other parts of the business use the Data Platform, including tools that help users find and access the data they need, understand the lineage of data, as well as developing self-serve tooling that helps users to publish to and consume from the platform.
Working in an agile software engineering team where you will have the opportunity to Influence technology selection.
Helping to establish good engineering processes within the team including: using infrastructure as code; contributing to automated testing efforts; utilising monitoring and alerting tools; and employing CI/CD best practices to deploy regularly to production.
