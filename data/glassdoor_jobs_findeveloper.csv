Company description
Quantum technologies have the potential to solve some of the world's biggest challenges. There have been great advances in all areas of quantum technologies, and new fields of application are opened up every day. Hybrid computer systems that combine classic high-performance computing with quantum computers are already being used to develop solutions in sectors such as logistics, healthcare, finance, energy, automotive and aerospace. Quantum mechanical predictions are also used to obtain unprecedented precision in measurements, generate unbreakable codes, and form the basis of impenetrable communication networks. All these developments are happening right now, and they are happening at Terra Quantum.
At Terra Quantum we are building the world's leading Quantum Technology company. We offer customers world-class quantum technology expertise organized as ""quantum-as-a-service"": hybrid quantum algorithms, quantum compute and quantum enabled security solutions.

In 2022, the company closed its Series A financing round with a $75m fundraise.
Quantum physics has, in some respects, parallels to the machine language of our computers-the zeros and ones into which our keyboard or touchscreen instructions are translated for execution in the computer-only on a larger scale: it is the machine language of the universe. The second quantum revolution is based on the control of individual quantum systems, such as individual atoms. We use quantum computers to solve currently unsolvable problems, simulate molecules and their interactions, find drugs for diseases that are not yet curable, find new materials, or make artificial intelligence stronger. Quantum is now.
Terra Quantum is a future-focused quantum services and technology company working on making the second quantum revolution a reality. Terra Quantum's activities span all areas, markets, and industries globally.

We've got 15 million customers across the globe and we're growing. Fast.
Current banking systems don't let us send, spend or receive money across borders easily. Or quickly. Or cheaply.
So, we're building a new one.
And, we need a Senior Backend Engineer to join our mission and help us build a global platform that's scalable, reliable and secure. We're working on lots of algorithmical challenges, and you'll dive right into projects on reconciliation, integrations, authorisations and authentications.
The team you'll be working with: Finance & Treasury
Treasury & Finance works with the core financial data of the company.
Treasury is a team with many time critical customer product supporting operational duties:
Making sure the risk and cost of offering all our currencies to customers are minimal
Making sure we have the right amount in the right account at the right time to pay customers
Making sure customer funds are managed in a compliant, safe and efficient way
The Finance team provides systems to run processes in an efficient, scalable and controlled manner to ensure timely and accurate financial reporting. It has a bigger focus on historical completeness and correctness of provided data and less on operational matters.
While the goals of these two teams are different, it is essential that they make their operational decisions on a well-aligned view of what is happening in the Wise business at any point in time from a financial perspective (both technically and process-wise) and contribute to making the business financially sustainable.
What does it take?:
A strong product mindset and passion for user experience, you prioritise work with the customers in mind and make data-driven decisions to fix customer pain-points
Great communication skills and the ability to articulate complex, technical concepts to non-technical audience
Experience working with relational and non-relational databases, query optimisation and designing schemas
You enjoy writing testable code and believe in Test Driven Development
You believe in and follow best coding practices, code reviews and open feedback
Experience with CI/CD pipelines and Distributed and Concurrent Systems
Hands on knowledge of system integration patterns
As a plus: you have solid Java 8 plus knowledge, experience with Spring framework and database abstraction layers like Hibernate
…but don't worry we don't expect you to know everything!
What does success look like?
You'll have onboarded and found your place through understanding your team and tribe vision and how you can contribute
You'll understand how our values can help you guide your work
You'll understand the reasons behind problematic payments and customer difficulties and how to go about solving them
You'll be raising the automation level to enable scaling of the product
Understand our customers and the impact our product makes in their lives
You'll help us scale-up and build a world class money transfer product by finding solutions to our technical challenges and opportunities
What you get back:
The autonomy to solve problems your way
The freedom to have real impact
Loads of development opportunities
A fun work environment with social activities and events
