What to Expect from our Interview Process
Our interview process is not a cookie cutter process and changes based on the candidate. In general, you should expect:

- An introductory meeting and an aptitude assessment. The aptitude assessment is not a pass/fail test, and we do the same aptitude assessment for all candidates coming to Symmetry - so it cannot be a test of competency for a certain role. We're trying to understand what you're good at and what you're bad at, to try to form a role around your strengths and weaknesses.

A meeting with a member of the team for an open discussion on your background, experiences and how you may fit into the team.

A meeting with someone technical. We're not looking for everyone to be a software developer, but we do like having technical people meet candidates to see how they approach complex problems, how they can break them down and solve them, and how they learn.

Iteration from there, based on the feedback from the interviews and any further interviews to try to figure out where you'd best fit within Symmetry and what role we can create for you.

Who are we?
We're Mediahub. A growing global media agency built specifically for challenger brands looking to challenge the status quo.
It is our secret sauce – media creativity – that truly differentiates us. In a world with more ad blockers and ad-free environments, ever greater media fragmentation and growing attention scarcity, not all impressions are equal. We believe this makes creativity the most powerful economic multiplier any media agency can leverage and is a critical ingredient for challenger brands seeking an unfair share of attention.
Although part of the MullenLowe Group, we are powered by IPG's Mediabrands and have access to all the resources, intelligence, and buying power associated with the largest media companies, but remain small enough to provide clients with our best people and move with great alacrity.

What will you do?
As our Econometrician, you will be responsible for the end to end modelling process from technical specification, development, delivery and maintenance and updates of models for our clients.
It's a fantastic opportunity to build a modern econometric proposition within an agency which believes in the challenger mindset whilst building on existing award winning work!
You will also be responsible for methodology and model selection and will work closely with our data engineer with regards to the agency's data infrastructure systems built on the AWS stack which we use to warehouse data suitable for modelling. You will also be the go to data technologist for our clients providing recommendations and roadmapping econometric solutions to answer questions and offer pivotal insight.

About you
This specialist senior role will suit candidates with a strong interest in unleashing the power of econometrics in the team and a demonstrable background in econometrics. The role offers those who are familiar with econometrics an opportunity to build our econometrics product, incorporating the latest thinking and to be pivotal in building super cool applications using ML such as our award winning NBD tool on our website as an example.
At Mediahub we believe that people are what make great places to work. We believe in meritocracy, and that hard work and star quality should get rewarded. You will need to be ready to hit the ground running, and looking to now do the best work of your career. If so, we'd look forward to meeting you.

Benefits
Extra holiday days you can buy, your birthday off, gym discounts, a running club, healthcare, discounted massages and just about everything else you can think of! Dedicated to our people, we provide extensive benefits to help with that work life balance. We focus on great people, great work, effectiveness, creativity and passion. If that sounds like the place for you then we want to meet you!

"XTX Markets
4.6",Quantitative Researcher,"London, England",£29K - £36K (Glassdoor Est.),-1,51 to 200 Employees,-1,Company - Private,Investment & Asset Management,Finance,Unknown / Non-Applicable,4.0,4.5,4.5,4.5,3.0,"Quantitative Researcher
THE ROLE
XTX Markets is an algorithmic trading firm that actively trades tens of thousands of instruments on over eighty venues with a daily volume of almost three hundred billion USD. Trading algorithms are developed by the quant team, which consists of fewer than twenty researchers and a research cluster of a hundred thousand cores and six thousand A/V100 GPUs (and growing fast). The algorithms we develop are necessarily extremely general and robust. The culture is collaborative and friendly. The team structure is flat. There is no bureaucracy.
Trading provides a unique set of challenges for machine learning research. Datasets contain trillions of observations. Markets constantly adapt. They react rapidly, often adversarially, to trades and, over longer horizons, to new trading strategies. Algorithms must be as fast as possible: every microsecond matters when reacting to new market information. At the same time, it is necessary to account for risks associated with holding periods that can be weeks – a range of timescales that spans twelve orders of magnitude.
The models that drive our trading strategies evolved considerably over the last 10 years, from econometric methods that gave a name to the company, to trees, to neural networks, to modern deep learning architectures. We are actively seeking new methods and ideas.
REQUIREMENTS
Degree in math, physics, computer science or another quantitative field
Strong evidence of ability to conduct original research
Demonstrated practical experience of, or deep understanding of, modern deep learning architectures
Good knowledge of other machine learning techniques and statistics
Solid programming skills (language does not matter)
OTHER BENEFICIAL QUALITIES (not required)
Track record of solving practical and analytical problems
Outstanding performance in any quantitative field or contest (Kaggle, hackathons, olympiads, academic contests etc)
Experience implementing machine learning algorithms in industry
HIRING PROCESS
Our interview process seeks to gain signal in the following topics:
Modern machine learning techniques, especially deep learning
Classical machine learning techniques
Probability theory
General mathematics (linear algebra, analysis etc)
Computer science / algorithms
Your process will follow the following format:
Phone or video call with a quant researcher covering the above topics. You may have a second if we do not cover all the topics
Practical assignment - we provide a dataset, and this exercise is about building a model end to end
Onsite interview - there will be 10 interviewers, and you will be interviewed on each topic twice
Success Criteria:
We seek to get a broad signal in our process. Successful candidates are those who are strong in all areas and exceed expectations in at least one

Frequently working alongside colleagues from across Grant Thornton, we advise on high profile issues in all major sectors of the economy.
Our Economic Consulting team works across three markets:
The legal market providing expert economic analysis to High Courts, International Arbitration Hearings and Competition Courts across a wide range of cases and settings
The public sector market providing advice to Governments, regulatory agencies and related agencies on policy and financing issues
The private sector market on a wide range of regulatory strategic and transactional issues.
In each of these markets our work requires strong econometric analysis. Given the growth of projects requiring these skills we are now looking to recruit a further Manager or Senior Manager to bolster our existing team. The scope of work you may be involved is exceptionally broad and could include estimation of complex counterfactuals, market demand forecasting, profitability analysis, estimation of default probabilities, valuation of companies, and estimation of damages alongside many other applications of econometrics.
Whilst our Economic Consulting practice is a separate operating unit that goes to market as a specialist provider, it also works closely with our market leading Financial Services Group (FSG), Public Sector Advisory (PAS) and Forensic and Investigations Services (FIS) practices. Given the nature of work in a multi-disciplinary firm, joint delivery and marketing with Directors and Partners from across the FSG, PAS and FIS practices will be a key part of this role.

Support the development of the economic consulting practice and its team members, potentially undertaking training and people management roles to support the development of less experienced team members.
Knowing you’re right for us
Joining us as an Econometrician, the minimum criteria is experience of using econometrics across a wide range of issues. However, your experience may have been more focused on a specific use of econometrics previously and want to expand that scope. It would be great if you had some of the following skills, but don't worry if you don't tick every box, we'll help you develop along the way.
Educated to a post graduate level as an economist, holding a PhD or an MSC with a substantial econometric component.
Whilst heavily in nature you must have the ability to explain your work to an informed but non specialist audience.
Substantial experience obtained from working within one or more of an economics consultancy, commercial firms, Government or regulatory authority.
Knowing we’re right for you
Embracing uniqueness, the culture at Grant Thornton thrives on the contributions of all our people, we never settle for what is easy, we look beyond to deliver the right thing, for everyone. Building an inclusive culture, where we value difference and respect our colleagues helps our people to perform at the best of their ability and realise their potential.

About the Group

The Model Risk Governance and Review Group (MRGR) oversees model risk at the firm, conducts independent model reviews, and provides guidance around a model's appropriate usage. The Group is tasked with assessing and mitigating the risk posed by usage of all types of quantitative models in the firm.

Job summary:

Financial Institutions routinely use models for a broad range of activities including credit underwriting, valuing financial instruments, measuring and managing risk, assessing the adequacy of reserves and capital resources, and many other applications. Model Risk arises from the potential adverse consequences of making decisions based on incorrect or misused model outputs and reports, leading to financial loss, poor business decision making, or reputational damage.

The Group (MRGR) is responsible for conducting model validation to help identify, measure, and mitigate Model Risk. The objective is to ensure that models are used appropriately in the business context and that model users are aware of the models' strengths and limitations and how these can impact their decisions.

The aim of the MRGR VaR group is to perform reviews of the Firm's VaR models and to ensure the way in which JP Morgan quantifies, monitors and manages risk is robust. This role involves examining the behavior of these risk models by examining their performance for different exposures and in varying market conditions. It entails exposure to a broad range of models, including the pricing models used to value derivatives, and statistical models of the risk factors used to estimate possible market scenarios.

MRGR carries out model validation activities and works closely with Risk, Finance and LOB professionals to review findings, and to perform on-going model risk measurement and risk mitigation strategies.

Core responsibilities:

The successful candidate will be a member of MRGR and will work on the validation of VaR models used in connection with regulatory capital measurement. The successful candidate will carry out a number of model validation activities, including:
Model reviews: evaluate conceptual soundness of model specification; reasonableness of assumptions and reliability of inputs; completeness of testing performed to support the correctness of the implementation; robustness of numerical aspects; suitability and comprehensiveness of performance metrics and risk measures associated with use of a model.
Model risk measurement: design and implement experiments to measure the potential impact of model limitations, parameter estimation error or deviations from model assumptions; compare model outputs with empirical evidence and/or outputs from model benchmarks.
Identify market conditions under which a model's performance may degrade.
Liaise with FO, Finance and Risk professionals to monitor usage and performance of the models and syndicate the findings of model validation.
Document and explain review findings to model developers and risk management.

Minimum Skills, Experience and Qualifications

We are looking for someone excited to join our organization. If you meet the minimum requirements below, you are encouraged to apply to be considered for this role.
An advanced degree in a subject such as Applied Mathematics, Economics, Physics, Statistics, Engineering or similar.

Excellent analytical and problem solving abilities.
Inquisitive nature, ability to ask right questions and to escalate issues. Risk & Control mindset.

THE ROLE
XTX Markets is an algorithmic trading firm that actively trades tens of thousands of instruments on over eighty venues with a daily volume of almost three hundred billion USD. Trading algorithms are developed by the quant team, which consists of fewer than twenty researchers and a research cluster of a hundred thousand cores and six thousand A/V100 GPUs (and growing fast). The algorithms we develop are necessarily extremely general and robust. The culture is collaborative and friendly. The team structure is flat. There is no bureaucracy.
Trading provides a unique set of challenges for machine learning research. Datasets contain trillions of observations. Markets constantly adapt. They react rapidly, often adversarially, to trades and, over longer horizons, to new trading strategies. Algorithms must be as fast as possible: every microsecond matters when reacting to new market information. At the same time, it is necessary to account for risks associated with holding periods that can be weeks – a range of timescales that spans twelve orders of magnitude.
The models that drive our trading strategies evolved considerably over the last 10 years, from econometric methods that gave a name to the company, to trees, to neural networks, to modern deep learning architectures. We are actively seeking new methods and ideas.
REQUIREMENTS
Degree in math, physics, computer science or another quantitative field
Strong evidence of ability to conduct original research
Demonstrated practical experience of, or deep understanding of, modern deep learning architectures
Good knowledge of other machine learning techniques and statistics
Solid programming skills (language does not matter)
OTHER BENEFICIAL QUALITIES (not required)
Track record of solving practical and analytical problems
Outstanding performance in any quantitative field or contest (Kaggle, hackathons, olympiads, academic contests etc)
Experience implementing machine learning algorithms in industry
HIRING PROCESS
Our interview process seeks to gain signal in the following topics:
Modern machine learning techniques, especially deep learning
Classical machine learning techniques
Probability theory
General mathematics (linear algebra, analysis etc)
Computer science / algorithms
Your process will follow the following format:
Phone or video call with a quant researcher covering the above topics. You may have a second if we do not cover all the topics
Practical assignment - we provide a dataset, and this exercise is about building a model end to end
Onsite interview - there will be 10 interviewers, and you will be interviewed on each topic twice
Success Criteria:
We seek to get a broad signal in our process. Successful candidates are those who are strong in all areas and exceed expectations in at least one

Financial Institutions routinely use models for a broad range of activities including credit underwriting, valuing financial instruments, measuring and managing risk, assessing the adequacy of reserves and capital resources, and many other applications. Model Risk arises from the potential adverse consequences of making decisions based on incorrect or misused model outputs and reports, leading to financial loss, poor business decision making, or reputational damage.

The Group (MRGR) is responsible for conducting model validation to help identify, measure, and mitigate Model Risk. The objective is to ensure that models are used appropriately in the business context and that model users are aware of the models' strengths and limitations and how these can impact their decisions.

The aim of the MRGR VaR group is to perform reviews of the Firm's VaR models and to ensure the way in which JP Morgan quantifies, monitors and manages risk is robust. This role involves examining the behavior of these risk models by examining their performance for different exposures and in varying market conditions. It entails exposure to a broad range of models, including the pricing models used to value derivatives, and statistical models of the risk factors used to estimate possible market scenarios.

MRGR carries out model validation activities and works closely with Risk, Finance and LOB professionals to review findings, and to perform on-going model risk measurement and risk mitigation strategies.

Core responsibilities:

The successful candidate will be a member of MRGR and will work on the validation of VaR models used in connection with regulatory capital measurement. The successful candidate will carry out a number of model validation activities, including:
Model reviews: evaluate conceptual soundness of model specification; reasonableness of assumptions and reliability of inputs; completeness of testing performed to support the correctness of the implementation; robustness of numerical aspects; suitability and comprehensiveness of performance metrics and risk measures associated with use of a model.
Model risk measurement: design and implement experiments to measure the potential impact of model limitations, parameter estimation error or deviations from model assumptions; compare model outputs with empirical evidence and/or outputs from model benchmarks.
Identify market conditions under which a model's performance may degrade.
Liaise with FO, Finance and Risk professionals to monitor usage and performance of the models and syndicate the findings of model validation.
Document and explain review findings to model developers and risk management.

Full-Time, Fixed Term (for 36 months) - 2x posts available
Applications are invited for the post of Postdoctoral Research Assistant in the Department of Economics.
Review for assistant professorship is negotiable at the time of contract.
We are looking for two highly motivated individuals to join the research project Social Mechanisms and Allocations led by the Principal Investigator (PI), Professor David Levine.
The main goal of this project is to study social mechanisms and their allocations. Social norms are crucial for groups to succeed: from political parties, to labour unions, to special interest groups, even to criminal gangs. Each of these groups faces a free-rider problem: it is in the interest of each individual in the group to let the others do the work of advancing the common interest. Norms are equally pivotal in persuading individuals not to engage in anti-social behaviour, from littering, to thievery, and worse, where again a divide appears between individual goals and larger interests
The project aims to link work in game theory to the operation of social norms in a heterogenous agents’ framework. The project will involve economists, psychologists, and computer scientists at Royal Holloway inorder to understand how social norms develop and sustain themselves. The project will explain and illustrate how a willingness of individuals to bear small costs for the sake of society can be leveraged into system-wide institutional changes. The results will address both large questions that have defined the modern era – how can individuals be convinced to obey social rules that are not normally in their self-interest to follow? – and smaller puzzles of how institutions can better function. Levine does not foresee one-size-fits-all solutions. The norms that support some groups such as volunteer organizations providing health assistance to the poor promote the greater good, while in other cases, such as with special interest lobbying organizations, they can do harm. Public policies should therefore aim to foster the formation of useful social norms in some cases and to transform existing norms in other cases.
Levine’s earlier work on dynamic games has laid out the rules in economics for when self-interested agents will sacrifice current benefits for longer-term gains, provides the theoretical bridge to the present project. The team will explore more concretely how agents who interact dynamically come to learn norms and how they build productive norms in the first place. In the last decades, there has been emerging interest in algorithms to make predictions and decisions in financial markets. The project intends to add a new dimension by studying the interaction between machines and humans.
To answer these questions, a considerable innovation of the project is the use of economic experiments along with algorithmic simulations.
The project has both theoretical and empirical focusses along with subject experiments. Proven research ability in economic theory or programming knowledge of Python or related languages are desirable. Moreover, data management skills and a high level of competence in econometrics and machine learning are desired. Experience in economic experiments would also be desirable. Most of all, the successful candidate will have a great enthusiasm to conduct research on this topic.

Full-Time, Fixed Term (for 36 months) - 2x posts available
Applications are invited for the post of Postdoctoral Research Assistant in the Department of Economics.
Review for assistant professorship is negotiable at the time of contract.
We are looking for two highly motivated individuals to join the research project Social Mechanisms and Allocations led by the Principal Investigator (PI), Professor David Levine.
The main goal of this project is to study social mechanisms and their allocations. Social norms are crucial for groups to succeed: from political parties, to labour unions, to special interest groups, even to criminal gangs. Each of these groups faces a free-rider problem: it is in the interest of each individual in the group to let the others do the work of advancing the common interest. Norms are equally pivotal in persuading individuals not to engage in anti-social behaviour, from littering, to thievery, and worse, where again a divide appears between individual goals and larger interests
The project aims to link work in game theory to the operation of social norms in a heterogenous agents’ framework. The project will involve economists, psychologists, and computer scientists at Royal Holloway inorder to understand how social norms develop and sustain themselves. The project will explain and illustrate how a willingness of individuals to bear small costs for the sake of society can be leveraged into system-wide institutional changes. The results will address both large questions that have defined the modern era – how can individuals be convinced to obey social rules that are not normally in their self-interest to follow? – and smaller puzzles of how institutions can better function. Levine does not foresee one-size-fits-all solutions. The norms that support some groups such as volunteer organizations providing health assistance to the poor promote the greater good, while in other cases, such as with special interest lobbying organizations, they can do harm. Public policies should therefore aim to foster the formation of useful social norms in some cases and to transform existing norms in other cases.
Levine’s earlier work on dynamic games has laid out the rules in economics for when self-interested agents will sacrifice current benefits for longer-term gains, provides the theoretical bridge to the present project. The team will explore more concretely how agents who interact dynamically come to learn norms and how they build productive norms in the first place. In the last decades, there has been emerging interest in algorithms to make predictions and decisions in financial markets. The project intends to add a new dimension by studying the interaction between machines and humans.
To answer these questions, a considerable innovation of the project is the use of economic experiments along with algorithmic simulations.
The project has both theoretical and empirical focusses along with subject experiments.

Smarkets was founded to fix betting. We have built an in-house exchange platform for betting and trading on sport and politics. The Smarkets exchange is a multi-billion pound trading platform with a rapidly growing ecosystem of sophisticated users who apply financial trading techniques to the world of betting. We're looking for a Quantitative Developer to join our Market-Making group.
Our stack consists of dockerized applications deployed on AWS. Our code is mostly Python with Rust used for performance critical components. We embrace the modern DevOps culture, practising continuous integration and deploying to production multiple times a day.
An Example project for the team:
""We are pricing lots of football leagues, some of which we know nothing about. There is a nice market making algorithm to price them, and reacts to trades in a way that is consistent across various markets (match winner, both teams to score, over/under etc.). I worked on a project to implement this algorithm in a proper way, starting from a ""back of the envelope"" prototype of it.
The work involved reading a mathematical paper about the algorithm, finding problems with the initial implementation and rewriting a large portion it to use faster data structures. Both of us wrote code, studied the theory, and analysed the speed and profitability of the algorithm in production. If an outsider looked at us working together, they wouldn't know who is the quant and who is the engineer.
An interesting part of the project was changing a data structure from dictionary to a Numpy array, which allowed us to change a summation in a nested loop into a single matrix multiplication. This made the code much simpler and faster.""
We are looking for a Quant Developer who will be working on the following key areas for the team:
Implementing, backtesting, shipping and monitoring data-based algorithms
Improving our technical and fundamental market models
Working to analyse market patterns
Defining your role in the context of self-management (we'll help you with this)
About You
Bachelor's degree in Computer Science, Mathematics, Physics or similar STEM subject.

Our Culture
Our vision at Smarkets is to fix the betting industry with the best products and prices. Smarkets is a Series B-funded company that brings a professional, tech-led approach to the sports and political betting industry with a sophisticated platform that has handled over £29 billion in traded volume.
We embrace collaboration, trust, innovation and scientific rigour, while we celebrate ambitious goals and passionate energy.

The Group

KPMG's Infrastructure Group in the UK consists of over 200 professionals and is widely recognised as one of the world's leading independent financial and business advisers in infrastructure.

We provide in-depth advice on the strategic, financial, regulatory and commercial issues driving investments in infrastructure across Transport, Power & Utilities, and Social Infrastructure in the UK and internationally. Our work includes market and policy design, economic analysis, deal structuring and execution, as well as strategic and transaction advice to enable private and public capital to fund infrastructure.

The utilities sector is a key business area for the Infrastructure Group and encompasses work for the large clients in the sector including all the leading UK energy and water companies. We provide in-depth strategic and technical advice on corporate finance issues, corporate financial management; regulatory finance, regulatory policy, business and financial planning, as well as other issues affecting value. We are widely recognised by many industry stakeholders as one of the most innovative advisors influencing the future of the sector.

Our business is expanding rapidly and is looking for a high-quality candidate to support our Power & Utilities business.

The Role

We are recruiting an associate director to join our cost efficiency team in the power and utilities group.

You will be working on a range of projects in the water and energy sectors. Your work will focus on cost efficiency but you will also provide support more broadly to the Power & Utilities team on economic regulation and policy development.

Our clients seek expert advice relating to cost benchmarking and cost assessment more broadly (for example cost benefit analysis of major projects). Our approach to benchmarking typically involves econometric models comparing costs across companies.

There is no 'typical project'. You will need to apply a structured strategic approach to problem solving, drawing on established economic principles, while having the capacity to think creatively.

The projects that you will advise on will be high profile and varied. In recent years we have advised nearly every water and energy network company on their price control reviews, been the lead advisor on several CMA appeals in both the water and gas distribution sectors, and advised on major transactions within the sectors.

This a senior position that involves a combination of report drafting, engaging with clients, and delivering and/or interpreting econometric analysis. You will be expected to be involved in the management of projects and to take a lead in developing proposals and other business development activities.

You will also take a key role in developing the consulting skills of more junior staff.

The Person

We are looking for someone with cost assessment experience and detailed knowledge of the regulatory framework of the water and energy sectors in the UK. You will have experience of managing medium size project teams, liaising with and presenting to clients/stakeholders and business development.

A successful candidate would bring excellent report writing, Excel and PowerPoint skills.

Ideally you will be highly skilled in quantitative economic analysis, with particular knowledge and experience of cost assessment and have good knowledge and experience of statistics and econometrics.

You will be an independent thinker with the ability to identify problems and contribute to the development of solutions, helping us to remain at the cutting edge of innovative thinking in the sector

What we will offer in return:
Competitive salary, company car allowance, and a discretionary annual bonus scheme
25 days holiday, with the option to buy up to an extra 10 days, plus an additional day of leave for your birthday
6 days of work time each year for volunteering
Daily lunch allowance

Job description
This is an exciting time to join the Department for Business Energy and Industrial Strategy as we deliver the Government’s Plan for Growth. The Consumer and Competition Policy (CCP) Directorate is at the heart of this agenda. What we do affects businesses, consumers and the overall economy. Getting it right is therefore critically important and we pride ourselves on the quality of our advice and our project delivery.

CCP is a great place to work – people are enabled and supported to perform to their best and the culture is energetic, collaborative, kind and inclusive with excellent flexible working.

The Analysis, Corporate Support and Digital Markets (ACDM) team leads analysis for the Directorate and in addition leads policy development on: a) digital competition policy (new powers to regulate the largest tech firms with legislation expected in the coming year); and b) Smart Data policy (policy aimed at letting customers benefit from their own data more); as well as corporate support services for the directorate.

The Analysis Team works with policy teams to provide high-quality and insightful analysis to support competition policy, consumer policy and subsidy control. Analysis supports all stages of policy development from early problem identification to policy evaluation.
Person specification
The review and reform of all Retained EU Law (REUL) is a key priority for the Prime Minister and Cabinet. The ambition is to reinstate the supremacy of UK law and seize the regulatory and economic opportunities of EU Exit. This is a considerable challenge; over 2,400 pieces of Retained EU Law will be reviewed before deciding whether they should be repealed, reformed, sunset or preserved at the end of 2023. This includes key pieces of consumer and competition law, for example:

Consumer Protection Regulations 2008 and Consumer Contracts Regulations 2013 which together provide fundamental rights, for example against misleading information and aggressive sales practices and regarding online purchases.
Package Travel Regulations which provide protections for those booking holiday packages at home and abroad, including in the case of insolvency for the organiser.

Rules on timeshares, crystal glass, textiles and footwear. Of which the latter three must be retained in NI under the Protocol.

Competition block exemptions which exempt certain agreements from competition law prohibitions, providing greater certainty for businesses.

We are looking to recruit two G7 analysts to the Analysis Team to support this priority in Consumer and Competition Policy.

The post holders will be responsible for:

Line and/or task management of the 4+ junior economists within the team, setting direction and supporting their development

Identifying opportunities for research to build the evidence base; developing and leading research projects where valuable

Leading workstream planning for the analysis of consumer and competition related REUL to ensure analysis is delivered to time and to a high standard

Leading cost-benefit analysis in line with the Better Regulation framework and REUL guidance to support decision-making
Working collaboratively with policy leads to ensure policy advice is evidence-based and founded on sound analysis

Promoting analysis and evidence-based policy making in CCP and contributing to the wider BEIS analytical community

Skills and Experience

Analytical skills – Experience of using analysis to support sound policy development. This includes developing cost-benefit analysis to appraise the impact of proposed policy measures. Experience of developing research specifications and procuring research is beneficial, but not essential.

Collaboration – Experience of collaborating with colleagues across professions and with different backgrounds to deliver shared outcomes.

Communication – Experience of communicating analysis to a non-technical audience.

Delivering at pace – Experience of effectively planning to deliver against tight timelines to a high quality.

Applicants should use their CV and personal statement to:

Taking responsibility and accountability for overall delivery and quality of evaluation projects from start to finish.
Leading smaller projects or managing large and complex projects, across different methodologies, including process evaluation, impact evaluation (with consideration of counterfactual), and cost-benefit analysis.

Signing-off deliverables (questionnaires, presentations and reports) which meet clients’ and stakeholders’ objectives, adopting creative approaches where relevant.
Assisting with proposals.
Developing a strong understanding of our clients’ needs and seeking opportunities to grow our business by taking a proactive approach to developing knowledge of the client’s needs.
Communicating effectively with clients, internal and external suppliers, and internal colleagues both in writing and verbally.
Supporting and supervising newer team members to deliver work and develop their own communication style whilst ensuring professionalism and outcomes which are in client and Ipsos’ long-term interests.
Effectively managing relationships with suppliers and internal operations colleagues to ensure the objectives of the research are met on time and to budget.
Thought leadership alongside Dr Lawton, a leading researcher in cultural capital, demonstrating how the application of evaluation methods and economic valuation techniques can inform policy decisions and feed into national accounts.
Generating innovative solutions: drawing on novel approaches from micro-economics, experimental and quasi-experimental econometric analysis, data science, and big datasets.
Contributing to the successful working of the Government and Society team and its positive, supportive environment where people are encouraged to challenge themselves to develop their skills.

What do I need to bring with me?

This role will suit candidates who enjoy working closely with clients, often delivering at a fast pace. We welcome interest from people with either a quantitative and/or economics background.
We are looking for someone with:
Desire to work closely with clients to maintain and grow our contracts.
Excellent quantitative research skills: able to lead multiple evaluation projects and support newer members of the team to develop their research and project management skills.
Ability to work to tight deadlines to deliver profitable work and assure quality of all outputs.
Ability to lead development of high quality research materials which answer client objectives.
Ability to understand and interpret complex data to draw out a clear narrative and insight to inform client decision making.
Excellent client handling and supplier negotiation skills.
Experience writing winning proposals including drafting costs.
Confident and clear written and verbal communication skills, including experience of preparing presentations (and ideally written reports) with a high level of accurate use of English.
We are happy and willing to support candidates to develop their knowledge of our clients’ policy areas so experience of this is not a prerequisite for applying.

EFC are looking for analytical, collaborative and highly motivated students to join us for our Summer Internship programme in London from July to August 2023. This Future Leaders Internship programme is an in-person internship for those who self-identify as Black ethnic minority background with a strong interest in a career in economic consulting.

The purpose of this programme is to provide students who have been historically underrepresented in global business advisory firms with the opportunity to gain first hand experience and learn about our Economic Financial Consulting. This could lead to an offer of a graduate role. You will gain access to many experts and professionals to grow your network, including senior leaders. We are seeking students from a variety of degrees.

Our team of consultants come from a wide variety for academic backgrounds. At FTI they develop skills in economics and finance as well as drawing on their problem solving and analytical skills to answer a range of questions for high-profile clients.

We specialise in two main areas:
Providing valuation advice about anything from large public companies to patents and trademarks. We do all types of work, but in particular we are the leading firm in advising on valuation issues before courts and tribunals all around the world; and
Economic regulatory advice, where we apply economic theory and in-depth experience to offer advice to both regulators and regulated companies on a wide range of issues.

We have offices in cities across the world, with more than 250 staff worldwide. In London, our EFC practice has more than 150 people and each year we look to recruit at least 15 graduates from any degree background.

Examples of the questions our clients ask us
What impact did Uber have on the earnings of Black Cab drivers in London?
What is a fair way to distribute money to artists from steaming service royalties?
How much extra cost did the NHS incur because a generic drug was kept off the UK market by an invalid patent?
How much is the brand name of a premiership football club worth?
What is the value of an airport in South Africa?
Do US stock exchanges undervalue Chinese companies?
As part of the Foskett Panel, how much compensation should business owners receive after they were wrongly made to close by Lloyds Bank?
Does an econometric analysis of a European bank's share price indicate that it was affected by the release of inside information?
How large are the benefits of subsidising rural broadband networks in Europe?



What You Will Do
Our project teams perform industry research and develop the knowledge and experience to perform detailed economic analysis and financial modelling to solve interesting questions. They benefit significantly from working closely with managers and other team members in small teams, as well as from direct exposure to some of the top experts in the industry.

What We Offer You

Who are we?
We're Mediahub. A growing global media agency built specifically for challenger brands looking to challenge the status quo.
It is our secret sauce – media creativity – that truly differentiates us. In a world with more ad blockers and ad-free environments, ever greater media fragmentation and growing attention scarcity, not all impressions are equal. We believe this makes creativity the most powerful economic multiplier any media agency can leverage and is a critical ingredient for challenger brands seeking an unfair share of attention.
Although part of the MullenLowe Group, we are powered by IPG's Mediabrands and have access to all the resources, intelligence, and buying power associated with the largest media companies, but remain small enough to provide clients with our best people and move with great alacrity.

What will you do?
As our Econometrician, you will be responsible for the end to end modelling process from technical specification, development, delivery and maintenance and updates of models for our clients.
It's a fantastic opportunity to build a modern econometric proposition within an agency which believes in the challenger mindset whilst building on existing award winning work!
You will also be responsible for methodology and model selection and will work closely with our data engineer with regards to the agency's data infrastructure systems built on the AWS stack which we use to warehouse data suitable for modelling. You will also be the go to data technologist for our clients providing recommendations and roadmapping econometric solutions to answer questions and offer pivotal insight.

About you
This specialist senior role will suit candidates with a strong interest in unleashing the power of econometrics in the team and a demonstrable background in econometrics. The role offers those who are familiar with econometrics an opportunity to build our econometrics product, incorporating the latest thinking and to be pivotal in building super cool applications using ML such as our award winning NBD tool on our website as an example.
At Mediahub we believe that people are what make great places to work. We believe in meritocracy, and that hard work and star quality should get rewarded. You will need to be ready to hit the ground running, and looking to now do the best work of your career. If so, we'd look forward to meeting you.

Benefits
Extra holiday days you can buy, your birthday off, gym discounts, a running club, healthcare, discounted massages and just about everything else you can think of! Dedicated to our people, we provide extensive benefits to help with that work life balance. We focus on great people, great work, effectiveness, creativity and passion. If that sounds like the place for you then we want to meet you!

What to Expect from our Interview Process
Our interview process is not a cookie cutter process and changes based on the candidate. In general, you should expect:

- An introductory meeting and an aptitude assessment. The aptitude assessment is not a pass/fail test, and we do the same aptitude assessment for all candidates coming to Symmetry - so it cannot be a test of competency for a certain role. We're trying to understand what you're good at and what you're bad at, to try to form a role around your strengths and weaknesses.

A meeting with a member of the team for an open discussion on your background, experiences and how you may fit into the team.

A meeting with someone technical. We're not looking for everyone to be a software developer, but we do like having technical people meet candidates to see how they approach complex problems, how they can break them down and solve them, and how they learn.

Iteration from there, based on the feedback from the interviews and any further interviews to try to figure out where you'd best fit within Symmetry and what role we can create for you.

How you split your time will depend on the meetings in your diary, projects you may be working on, the time of the role etc - we want you to be able to embrace the flexibility while thinking about what works best for The Company, Your clients and You. In addition we provide 28 days annual leave with the option to purchase an additional 10.

Frontier is entirely owned by its employees. As Shareholders, we encourage everyone to put forward their views.

More than you expected
Grant Thornton UK LLP is part of a global network of independent audit, tax and advisory firms, made up of some 58,000 people in over 135 countries. We're a team of independent thinkers who put quality, inclusion and integrity first. All around the world we bring a different experience to our clients. A better experience. One that delivers the expertise they need in a way that goes beyond. Personal, proactive, and agile. That's Grant Thornton.
Job Description:
NEW GROUND WON’T BREAK ITSELF.
Every day our teams help people in businesses and communities to do what is right and achieve their goals.
Grant Thornton is making major investment in the formation of Grant Thornton Economic Consulting - providing specialist economic advice across all our legal, corporate and public sector clients. Frequently working alongside colleagues from across Grant Thornton, we advise on high profile issues in all major sectors of the economy.
Our Economic Consulting team works across three markets:
The legal market providing expert economic analysis to High Courts, International Arbitration Hearings and Competition Courts across a wide range of cases and settings
The public sector market providing advice to Governments, regulatory agencies and related agencies on policy and financing issues
The private sector market on a wide range of regulatory strategic and transactional issues.
In each of these markets our work requires strong econometric analysis. Given the growth of projects requiring these skills we are now looking to recruit a further Manager or Senior Manager to bolster our existing team. The scope of work you may be involved is exceptionally broad and could include estimation of complex counterfactuals, market demand forecasting, profitability analysis, estimation of default probabilities, valuation of companies, and estimation of damages alongside many other applications of econometrics.
Whilst our Economic Consulting practice is a separate operating unit that goes to market as a specialist provider, it also works closely with our market leading Financial Services Group (FSG), Public Sector Advisory (PAS) and Forensic and Investigations Services (FIS) practices. Given the nature of work in a multi-disciplinary firm, joint delivery and marketing with Directors and Partners from across the FSG, PAS and FIS practices will be a key part of this role.
We’re happy to talk flexible working and consider reduced hours and job shares, we’ll support you to balance your work and life.
A look into the role
As an Econometrician within our Economic Consulting team, you will be:
Responsible for the delivery and quality assurance of econometric work across the wide range of projects conducted across the team
Work closely with a small team of other similarly skilled team members focused on quantitative issues
Working alongside other Directors and Partners from Economic Consulting and other parts of the firm to co tribute to proposals and build relationships across the firms client base
Support the development of the economic consulting practice and its team members, potentially undertaking training and people management roles to support the development of less experienced team members.
Knowing you’re right for us
Joining us as an Econometrician, the minimum criteria is experience of using econometrics across a wide range of issues. However, your experience may have been more focused on a specific use of econometrics previously and want to expand that scope. It would be great if you had some of the following skills, but don't worry if you don't tick every box, we'll help you develop along the way.
Educated to a post graduate level as an economist, holding a PhD or an MSC with a substantial econometric component.
Whilst heavily in nature you must have the ability to explain your work to an informed but non specialist audience.
Substantial experience obtained from working within one or more of an economics consultancy, commercial firms, Government or regulatory authority.
Knowing we’re right for you
Embracing uniqueness, the culture at Grant Thornton thrives on the contributions of all our people, we never settle for what is easy, we look beyond to deliver the right thing, for everyone. Building an inclusive culture, where we value difference and respect our colleagues helps our people to perform at the best of their ability and realise their potential.
Our open and accessible culture means you’ll interact with leaders who are interested in you and everything you bring to our firm. The things that set you apart, we value them. That’s why we give you the freedom to bring your whole self to work and pursue your passions inside and outside of work.
Beyond the job
Life is more than work. The things you do, and the people you’re with outside of work matter, that’s why we’re happy to look at flexible working options for all our roles, and we’ll always do our best to keep your work and life in balance.
The impact you can make here will go far beyond your day job. From secondments, to fundraising for local charities, or investing in entrepreneurs in the developing world, you’ll be giving back to society. It’s that drive to do the right thing that runs through our every move, grounded in our CLEARR values – Collaboration, Leadership, Excellence, Agility, Respect and Responsibility.
We’re looking for people who want to contribute, spark fresh ideas and go beyond expectations. People who want to be able to proudly do what’s right, for the firm, our clients, our people and themselves. It’s how it should be.

Who are we?
We're Mediahub. A growing global media agency built specifically for challenger brands looking to challenge the status quo.
It is our secret sauce – media creativity – that truly differentiates us. In a world with more ad blockers and ad-free environments, ever greater media fragmentation and growing attention scarcity, not all impressions are equal. We believe this makes creativity the most powerful economic multiplier any media agency can leverage and is a critical ingredient for challenger brands seeking an unfair share of attention.
Although part of the MullenLowe Group, we are powered by IPG's Mediabrands and have access to all the resources, intelligence, and buying power associated with the largest media companies, but remain small enough to provide clients with our best people and move with great alacrity.

What will you do?
As our Econometrician, you will be responsible for the end to end modelling process from technical specification, development, delivery and maintenance and updates of models for our clients.
It's a fantastic opportunity to build a modern econometric proposition within an agency which believes in the challenger mindset whilst building on existing award winning work!
You will also be responsible for methodology and model selection and will work closely with our data engineer with regards to the agency's data infrastructure systems built on the AWS stack which we use to warehouse data suitable for modelling. You will also be the go to data technologist for our clients providing recommendations and roadmapping econometric solutions to answer questions and offer pivotal insight.

About you
This specialist senior role will suit candidates with a strong interest in unleashing the power of econometrics in the team and a demonstrable background in econometrics. The role offers those who are familiar with econometrics an opportunity to build our econometrics product, incorporating the latest thinking and to be pivotal in building super cool applications using ML such as our award winning NBD tool on our website as an example.
At Mediahub we believe that people are what make great places to work. We believe in meritocracy, and that hard work and star quality should get rewarded. You will need to be ready to hit the ground running, and looking to now do the best work of your career. If so, we'd look forward to meeting you.

Benefits
Extra holiday days you can buy, your birthday off, gym discounts, a running club, healthcare, discounted massages and just about everything else you can think of! Dedicated to our people, we provide extensive benefits to help with that work life balance. We focus on great people, great work, effectiveness, creativity and passion. If that sounds like the place for you then we want to meet you!

At Symmetry Investments, we seek to engage in intelligent risk-taking to create value for our clients, partners and employees. We derive our edge from our capacity to generate Win-Wins – in the broadest sense. Win-Win is our fundamental ethical and strategic principle. By generating Win-Wins, we can create unique solutions that reconcile perspectives that are usually seen as incompatible or opposites, and encompass the best that each side has to offer:
We integrate fixed-income arbitrage with global macro strategies in a novel way.
We invent and develop technology that focuses on the potential of human-machine integration.
We build systems where machines do what they do best, supporting people to do what people do best.
We are creating a collaborative meritocracy: a culture where individual contribution serves both personal and collective goals - and is rewarded accordingly.
We value both ownership thinking AND cooperative team spirit, self-realization AND community.

Job Description

We are seeking a candidate for a Quantitative Macro Researcher position focusing on inflation markets of developed countries. The position is within the Quantitative Macro Research team responsible for developing tools to analyse macro economic developments as well as identify opportunities in fixed income and FX markets.

Your role will include developing discretionary frameworks and quantitative models. You will also conduct thematic and ad-hoc research when necessary. You will use these frameworks to recommend practical investment opportunities. Specific focus will be on the UK market, initially. In addition, you will implement your models within our technology systems as well as visualise research output. You will create processes and tests to ensure robust implementation of the models, data used and processes to run these models. You should be hands on to be able to work with data, implement models and deliver results. You will be consulting with other researchers and interacting with developers on performing the analysis, prototyping a solution and automating research workflow.

We value interest and capabilities, entrepreneurial spirit as much as formal experience. Academic credentials are not a requirement if you can demonstrate your skills and added value. You will be working in a creative, less-structured environment, with a degree of autonomy to implement solutions. You will be able to think about problems in a high-level way using pragmatically common sense. You are comfortable asking for help when you need it. You are capable of accepting direction should a particular solution fit with the longer-term strategic goals of the firm.

What work will the successful candidate do in the first 3-6 months
Work on existing frameworks for the discretionary and quantitative valuation of inflation
bottom up and top down models of inflation
leading indicators
fixing analysis
Develop new tools to identify developments in inflation markets
Monitor macroeconomic developments, identify trends
Specific macro focus will be on UK inflation including modelling of RPI indices
Recommend trade ideas in inflation markets to Portfolio Management team
Implement quantitative frameworks within the technology infrastructure of the firm; work on visualisation tools to ensure that the output of the created models is distributed within the firm
Requirements
Practical knowledge of inflation markets, key drivers, valuation frameworks
Experience with the UK market (RPI) is a plus. Candidates who lack this experience are still encouraged to apply as we provide specific market training
Excellent problem solving and diagnostic skills
Understanding of financial economics, knowledge of statistics / econometrics
Curiosity and confidence in supporting new technologies, software, programming languages
Knowledge of at least of one programming language (Julia, Python, Matlab, D, other)
Ability to work under pressure and able to prioritize work
Highly detail oriented, self-directed, entrepreneurial and keen to learn
Exceptional verbal and written communication skills
Ability to present complex research outcomes with clarity and brevity

You will need to show us examples of any publicly-shareable code that you’ve written (hobby projects, open source contributions). A link to your GitHub would help expedite the selection process.
What to Expect from our Interview Process
Our interview process is not a cookie cutter process and changes based on the candidate. In general, you should expect:

- An introductory meeting and an aptitude assessment. The aptitude assessment is not a pass/fail test, and we do the same aptitude assessment for all candidates coming to Symmetry - so it cannot be a test of competency for a certain role. We're trying to understand what you're good at and what you're bad at, to try to form a role around your strengths and weaknesses.

A meeting with a member of the team for an open discussion on your background, experiences and how you may fit into the team.

A meeting with someone technical. We're not looking for everyone to be a software developer, but we do like having technical people meet candidates to see how they approach complex problems, how they can break them down and solve them, and how they learn.

Iteration from there, based on the feedback from the interviews and any further interviews to try to figure out where you'd best fit within Symmetry and what role we can create for you.

More than you expected
Grant Thornton UK LLP is part of a global network of independent audit, tax and advisory firms, made up of some 58,000 people in over 135 countries. We're a team of independent thinkers who put quality, inclusion and integrity first. All around the world we bring a different experience to our clients. A better experience. One that delivers the expertise they need in a way that goes beyond. Personal, proactive, and agile. That's Grant Thornton.
Job Description:
NEW GROUND WON’T BREAK ITSELF.
Every day our teams help people in businesses and communities to do what is right and achieve their goals.
Grant Thornton is making major investment in the formation of Grant Thornton Economic Consulting - providing specialist economic advice across all our legal, corporate and public sector clients. Frequently working alongside colleagues from across Grant Thornton, we advise on high profile issues in all major sectors of the economy.
Our Economic Consulting team works across three markets:
The legal market providing expert economic analysis to High Courts, International Arbitration Hearings and Competition Courts across a wide range of cases and settings
The public sector market providing advice to Governments, regulatory agencies and related agencies on policy and financing issues
The private sector market on a wide range of regulatory strategic and transactional issues.
In each of these markets our work requires strong econometric analysis. Given the growth of projects requiring these skills we are now looking to recruit a further Manager or Senior Manager to bolster our existing team. The scope of work you may be involved is exceptionally broad and could include estimation of complex counterfactuals, market demand forecasting, profitability analysis, estimation of default probabilities, valuation of companies, and estimation of damages alongside many other applications of econometrics.
Whilst our Economic Consulting practice is a separate operating unit that goes to market as a specialist provider, it also works closely with our market leading Financial Services Group (FSG), Public Sector Advisory (PAS) and Forensic and Investigations Services (FIS) practices. Given the nature of work in a multi-disciplinary firm, joint delivery and marketing with Directors and Partners from across the FSG, PAS and FIS practices will be a key part of this role.
We’re happy to talk flexible working and consider reduced hours and job shares, we’ll support you to balance your work and life.
A look into the role
As an Econometrician within our Economic Consulting team, you will be:
Responsible for the delivery and quality assurance of econometric work across the wide range of projects conducted across the team
Work closely with a small team of other similarly skilled team members focused on quantitative issues
Working alongside other Directors and Partners from Economic Consulting and other parts of the firm to co tribute to proposals and build relationships across the firms client base
Support the development of the economic consulting practice and its team members, potentially undertaking training and people management roles to support the development of less experienced team members.
Knowing you’re right for us
Joining us as an Econometrician, the minimum criteria is experience of using econometrics across a wide range of issues. However, your experience may have been more focused on a specific use of econometrics previously and want to expand that scope. It would be great if you had some of the following skills, but don't worry if you don't tick every box, we'll help you develop along the way.
Educated to a post graduate level as an economist, holding a PhD or an MSC with a substantial econometric component.
Whilst heavily in nature you must have the ability to explain your work to an informed but non specialist audience.
Substantial experience obtained from working within one or more of an economics consultancy, commercial firms, Government or regulatory authority.
Knowing we’re right for you

How much extra cost did the NHS incur because a generic drug was kept off the UK market by an invalid patent?
How much is the brand name of a premiership football club worth?
What is the value of an airport in South Africa?
Do US stock exchanges undervalue Chinese companies?

How large are the benefits of subsidising rural broadband networks in Europe?

Who are we?
We're Mediahub. A growing global media agency built specifically for challenger brands looking to challenge the status quo.
It is our secret sauce – media creativity – that truly differentiates us. In a world with more ad blockers and ad-free environments, ever greater media fragmentation and growing attention scarcity, not all impressions are equal. We believe this makes creativity the most powerful economic multiplier any media agency can leverage and is a critical ingredient for challenger brands seeking an unfair share of attention.
Although part of the MullenLowe Group, we are powered by IPG's Mediabrands and have access to all the resources, intelligence, and buying power associated with the largest media companies, but remain small enough to provide clients with our best people and move with great alacrity.

What will you do?
As our Econometrician, you will be responsible for the end to end modelling process from technical specification, development, delivery and maintenance and updates of models for our clients.
It's a fantastic opportunity to build a modern econometric proposition within an agency which believes in the challenger mindset whilst building on existing award winning work!
You will also be responsible for methodology and model selection and will work closely with our data engineer with regards to the agency's data infrastructure systems built on the AWS stack which we use to warehouse data suitable for modelling. You will also be the go to data technologist for our clients providing recommendations and roadmapping econometric solutions to answer questions and offer pivotal insight.

About you
This specialist senior role will suit candidates with a strong interest in unleashing the power of econometrics in the team and a demonstrable background in econometrics. The role offers those who are familiar with econometrics an opportunity to build our econometrics product, incorporating the latest thinking and to be pivotal in building super cool applications using ML such as our award winning NBD tool on our website as an example.
At Mediahub we believe that people are what make great places to work. We believe in meritocracy, and that hard work and star quality should get rewarded. You will need to be ready to hit the ground running, and looking to now do the best work of your career. If so, we'd look forward to meeting you.

Benefits
Extra holiday days you can buy, your birthday off, gym discounts, a running club, healthcare, discounted massages and just about everything else you can think of! Dedicated to our people, we provide extensive benefits to help with that work life balance. We focus on great people, great work, effectiveness, creativity and passion. If that sounds like the place for you then we want to meet you!
Mediahub is an equal opportunity employer. We celebrate diversity and are committed to creating an inclusive environment for all employees.

Symmetry Investments is a global investment company with offices in Hong Kong, Singapore, London, Jersey and Cayman Islands. We have been in business since 2014 after successfully spinning off from a major New York-based hedge fund.

At Symmetry Investments, we seek to engage in intelligent risk-taking to create value for our clients, partners and employees. We derive our edge from our capacity to generate Win-Wins – in the broadest sense. Win-Win is our fundamental ethical and strategic principle. By generating Win-Wins, we can create unique solutions that reconcile perspectives that are usually seen as incompatible or opposites, and encompass the best that each side has to offer:
We integrate fixed-income arbitrage with global macro strategies in a novel way.
We invent and develop technology that focuses on the potential of human-machine integration.
We build systems where machines do what they do best, supporting people to do what people do best.
We are creating a collaborative meritocracy: a culture where individual contribution serves both personal and collective goals - and is rewarded accordingly.
We value both ownership thinking AND cooperative team spirit, self-realization AND community.

Job Description

We are seeking a candidate for a Quantitative Macro Researcher position focusing on inflation markets of developed countries. The position is within the Quantitative Macro Research team responsible for developing tools to analyse macro economic developments as well as identify opportunities in fixed income and FX markets.

Your role will include developing discretionary frameworks and quantitative models. You will also conduct thematic and ad-hoc research when necessary. You will use these frameworks to recommend practical investment opportunities. Specific focus will be on the UK market, initially. In addition, you will implement your models within our technology systems as well as visualise research output. You will create processes and tests to ensure robust implementation of the models, data used and processes to run these models. You should be hands on to be able to work with data, implement models and deliver results. You will be consulting with other researchers and interacting with developers on performing the analysis, prototyping a solution and automating research workflow.

We value interest and capabilities, entrepreneurial spirit as much as formal experience. Academic credentials are not a requirement if you can demonstrate your skills and added value. You will be working in a creative, less-structured environment, with a degree of autonomy to implement solutions. You will be able to think about problems in a high-level way using pragmatically common sense. You are comfortable asking for help when you need it. You are capable of accepting direction should a particular solution fit with the longer-term strategic goals of the firm.

What work will the successful candidate do in the first 3-6 months
Work on existing frameworks for the discretionary and quantitative valuation of inflation
bottom up and top down models of inflation
leading indicators
fixing analysis
Develop new tools to identify developments in inflation markets
Monitor macroeconomic developments, identify trends
Specific macro focus will be on UK inflation including modelling of RPI indices
Recommend trade ideas in inflation markets to Portfolio Management team
Implement quantitative frameworks within the technology infrastructure of the firm; work on visualisation tools to ensure that the output of the created models is distributed within the firm
Requirements
Practical knowledge of inflation markets, key drivers, valuation frameworks
Experience with the UK market (RPI) is a plus. Candidates who lack this experience are still encouraged to apply as we provide specific market training
Excellent problem solving and diagnostic skills
Understanding of financial economics, knowledge of statistics / econometrics
Curiosity and confidence in supporting new technologies, software, programming languages
Knowledge of at least of one programming language (Julia, Python, Matlab, D, other)
Ability to work under pressure and able to prioritize work
Highly detail oriented, self-directed, entrepreneurial and keen to learn
Exceptional verbal and written communication skills
Ability to present complex research outcomes with clarity and brevity

You will need to show us examples of any publicly-shareable code that you’ve written (hobby projects, open source contributions). A link to your GitHub would help expedite the selection process.
What to Expect from our Interview Process
Our interview process is not a cookie cutter process and changes based on the candidate. In general, you should expect:

- An introductory meeting and an aptitude assessment. The aptitude assessment is not a pass/fail test, and we do the same aptitude assessment for all candidates coming to Symmetry - so it cannot be a test of competency for a certain role. We're trying to understand what you're good at and what you're bad at, to try to form a role around your strengths and weaknesses.

A meeting with a member of the team for an open discussion on your background, experiences and how you may fit into the team.

A meeting with someone technical. We're not looking for everyone to be a software developer, but we do like having technical people meet candidates to see how they approach complex problems, how they can break them down and solve them, and how they learn.

Iteration from there, based on the feedback from the interviews and any further interviews to try to figure out where you'd best fit within Symmetry and what role we can create for you.

More than you expected
Grant Thornton UK LLP is part of a global network of independent audit, tax and advisory firms, made up of some 58,000 people in over 135 countries. We're a team of independent thinkers who put quality, inclusion and integrity first. All around the world we bring a different experience to our clients. A better experience. One that delivers the expertise they need in a way that goes beyond. Personal, proactive, and agile. That's Grant Thornton.
Job Description:
NEW GROUND WON’T BREAK ITSELF.
Every day our teams help people in businesses and communities to do what is right and achieve their goals.
Grant Thornton is making major investment in the formation of Grant Thornton Economic Consulting - providing specialist economic advice across all our legal, corporate and public sector clients. Frequently working alongside colleagues from across Grant Thornton, we advise on high profile issues in all major sectors of the economy.
Our Economic Consulting team works across three markets:
The legal market providing expert economic analysis to High Courts, International Arbitration Hearings and Competition Courts across a wide range of cases and settings
The public sector market providing advice to Governments, regulatory agencies and related agencies on policy and financing issues
The private sector market on a wide range of regulatory strategic and transactional issues.
In each of these markets our work requires strong econometric analysis. Given the growth of projects requiring these skills we are now looking to recruit a further Manager or Senior Manager to bolster our existing team. The scope of work you may be involved is exceptionally broad and could include estimation of complex counterfactuals, market demand forecasting, profitability analysis, estimation of default probabilities, valuation of companies, and estimation of damages alongside many other applications of econometrics.
Whilst our Economic Consulting practice is a separate operating unit that goes to market as a specialist provider, it also works closely with our market leading Financial Services Group (FSG), Public Sector Advisory (PAS) and Forensic and Investigations Services (FIS) practices. Given the nature of work in a multi-disciplinary firm, joint delivery and marketing with Directors and Partners from across the FSG, PAS and FIS practices will be a key part of this role.
We’re happy to talk flexible working and consider reduced hours and job shares, we’ll support you to balance your work and life.
A look into the role
As an Econometrician within our Economic Consulting team, you will be:
Responsible for the delivery and quality assurance of econometric work across the wide range of projects conducted across the team
Work closely with a small team of other similarly skilled team members focused on quantitative issues
Working alongside other Directors and Partners from Economic Consulting and other parts of the firm to co tribute to proposals and build relationships across the firms client base
Support the development of the economic consulting practice and its team members, potentially undertaking training and people management roles to support the development of less experienced team members.
Knowing you’re right for us
Joining us as an Econometrician, the minimum criteria is experience of using econometrics across a wide range of issues. However, your experience may have been more focused on a specific use of econometrics previously and want to expand that scope. It would be great if you had some of the following skills, but don't worry if you don't tick every box, we'll help you develop along the way.
Educated to a post graduate level as an economist, holding a PhD or an MSC with a substantial econometric component.
Whilst heavily in nature you must have the ability to explain your work to an informed but non specialist audience.
Substantial experience obtained from working within one or more of an economics consultancy, commercial firms, Government or regulatory authority.
Knowing we’re right for you
Embracing uniqueness, the culture at Grant Thornton thrives on the contributions of all our people, we never settle for what is easy, we look beyond to deliver the right thing, for everyone. Building an inclusive culture, where we value difference and respect our colleagues helps our people to perform at the best of their ability and realise their potential.
Our open and accessible culture means you’ll interact with leaders who are interested in you and everything you bring to our firm. The things that set you apart, we value them. That’s why we give you the freedom to bring your whole self to work and pursue your passions inside and outside of work.
Beyond the job
Life is more than work. The things you do, and the people you’re with outside of work matter, that’s why we’re happy to look at flexible working options for all our roles, and we’ll always do our best to keep your work and life in balance.
The impact you can make here will go far beyond your day job. From secondments, to fundraising for local charities, or investing in entrepreneurs in the developing world, you’ll be giving back to society. It’s that drive to do the right thing that runs through our every move, grounded in our CLEARR values – Collaboration, Leadership, Excellence, Agility, Respect and Responsibility.
We’re looking for people who want to contribute, spark fresh ideas and go beyond expectations. People who want to be able to proudly do what’s right, for the firm, our clients, our people and themselves. It’s how it should be.

Who are we?
We're Mediahub. A growing global media agency built specifically for challenger brands looking to challenge the status quo.
It is our secret sauce – media creativity – that truly differentiates us. In a world with more ad blockers and ad-free environments, ever greater media fragmentation and growing attention scarcity, not all impressions are equal. We believe this makes creativity the most powerful economic multiplier any media agency can leverage and is a critical ingredient for challenger brands seeking an unfair share of attention.
Although part of the MullenLowe Group, we are powered by IPG's Mediabrands and have access to all the resources, intelligence, and buying power associated with the largest media companies, but remain small enough to provide clients with our best people and move with great alacrity.

What will you do?
As our Econometrician, you will be responsible for the end to end modelling process from technical specification, development, delivery and maintenance and updates of models for our clients.
It's a fantastic opportunity to build a modern econometric proposition within an agency which believes in the challenger mindset whilst building on existing award winning work!
You will also be responsible for methodology and model selection and will work closely with our data engineer with regards to the agency's data infrastructure systems built on the AWS stack which we use to warehouse data suitable for modelling. You will also be the go to data technologist for our clients providing recommendations and roadmapping econometric solutions to answer questions and offer pivotal insight.

About you
This specialist senior role will suit candidates with a strong interest in unleashing the power of econometrics in the team and a demonstrable background in econometrics. The role offers those who are familiar with econometrics an opportunity to build our econometrics product, incorporating the latest thinking and to be pivotal in building super cool applications using ML such as our award winning NBD tool on our website as an example.
At Mediahub we believe that people are what make great places to work. We believe in meritocracy, and that hard work and star quality should get rewarded. You will need to be ready to hit the ground running, and looking to now do the best work of your career. If so, we'd look forward to meeting you.

Benefits
Extra holiday days you can buy, your birthday off, gym discounts, a running club, healthcare, discounted massages and just about everything else you can think of! Dedicated to our people, we provide extensive benefits to help with that work life balance. We focus on great people, great work, effectiveness, creativity and passion. If that sounds like the place for you then we want to meet you!
Mediahub is an equal opportunity employer. We celebrate diversity and are committed to creating an inclusive environment for all employees.

At Symmetry Investments, we seek to engage in intelligent risk-taking to create value for our clients, partners and employees. We derive our edge from our capacity to generate Win-Wins – in the broadest sense. Win-Win is our fundamental ethical and strategic principle. By generating Win-Wins, we can create unique solutions that reconcile perspectives that are usually seen as incompatible or opposites, and encompass the best that each side has to offer:
We integrate fixed-income arbitrage with global macro strategies in a novel way.
We invent and develop technology that focuses on the potential of human-machine integration.
We build systems where machines do what they do best, supporting people to do what people do best.
We are creating a collaborative meritocracy: a culture where individual contribution serves both personal and collective goals - and is rewarded accordingly.
We value both ownership thinking AND cooperative team spirit, self-realization AND community.

Job Description

We are seeking a candidate for a Quantitative Macro Researcher position focusing on inflation markets of developed countries. The position is within the Quantitative Macro Research team responsible for developing tools to analyse macro economic developments as well as identify opportunities in fixed income and FX markets.

Your role will include developing discretionary frameworks and quantitative models. You will also conduct thematic and ad-hoc research when necessary. You will use these frameworks to recommend practical investment opportunities. Specific focus will be on the UK market, initially. In addition, you will implement your models within our technology systems as well as visualise research output. You will create processes and tests to ensure robust implementation of the models, data used and processes to run these models. You should be hands on to be able to work with data, implement models and deliver results. You will be consulting with other researchers and interacting with developers on performing the analysis, prototyping a solution and automating research workflow.

We value interest and capabilities, entrepreneurial spirit as much as formal experience. Academic credentials are not a requirement if you can demonstrate your skills and added value. You will be working in a creative, less-structured environment, with a degree of autonomy to implement solutions. You will be able to think about problems in a high-level way using pragmatically common sense. You are comfortable asking for help when you need it. You are capable of accepting direction should a particular solution fit with the longer-term strategic goals of the firm.

What work will the successful candidate do in the first 3-6 months
Work on existing frameworks for the discretionary and quantitative valuation of inflation
bottom up and top down models of inflation
leading indicators
fixing analysis
Develop new tools to identify developments in inflation markets
Monitor macroeconomic developments, identify trends
Specific macro focus will be on UK inflation including modelling of RPI indices
Recommend trade ideas in inflation markets to Portfolio Management team
Implement quantitative frameworks within the technology infrastructure of the firm; work on visualisation tools to ensure that the output of the created models is distributed within the firm
Requirements
Practical knowledge of inflation markets, key drivers, valuation frameworks
Experience with the UK market (RPI) is a plus. Candidates who lack this experience are still encouraged to apply as we provide specific market training
Excellent problem solving and diagnostic skills
Understanding of financial economics, knowledge of statistics / econometrics
Curiosity and confidence in supporting new technologies, software, programming languages
Knowledge of at least of one programming language (Julia, Python, Matlab, D, other)
Ability to work under pressure and able to prioritize work
Highly detail oriented, self-directed, entrepreneurial and keen to learn
Exceptional verbal and written communication skills
Ability to present complex research outcomes with clarity and brevity

You will need to show us examples of any publicly-shareable code that you’ve written (hobby projects, open source contributions). A link to your GitHub would help expedite the selection process.
What to Expect from our Interview Process
Our interview process is not a cookie cutter process and changes based on the candidate. In general, you should expect:

- An introductory meeting and an aptitude assessment. The aptitude assessment is not a pass/fail test, and we do the same aptitude assessment for all candidates coming to Symmetry - so it cannot be a test of competency for a certain role. We're trying to understand what you're good at and what you're bad at, to try to form a role around your strengths and weaknesses.

A meeting with a member of the team for an open discussion on your background, experiences and how you may fit into the team.

A meeting with someone technical. We're not looking for everyone to be a software developer, but we do like having technical people meet candidates to see how they approach complex problems, how they can break them down and solve them, and how they learn.

Iteration from there, based on the feedback from the interviews and any further interviews to try to figure out where you'd best fit within Symmetry and what role we can create for you.

We're a team of independent thinkers who put quality, inclusion and integrity first. All around the world we bring a different experience to our clients. A better experience. One that delivers the expertise they need in a way that goes beyond. Personal, proactive, and agile. That's Grant Thornton.
Job Description:
NEW GROUND WON’T BREAK ITSELF.
Every day our teams help people in businesses and communities to do what is right and achieve their goals.
Grant Thornton is making major investment in the formation of Grant Thornton Economic Consulting - providing specialist economic advice across all our legal, corporate and public sector clients. Frequently working alongside colleagues from across Grant Thornton, we advise on high profile issues in all major sectors of the economy.
Our Economic Consulting team works across three markets:
The legal market providing expert economic analysis to High Courts, International Arbitration Hearings and Competition Courts across a wide range of cases and settings
The public sector market providing advice to Governments, regulatory agencies and related agencies on policy and financing issues
The private sector market on a wide range of regulatory strategic and transactional issues.
In each of these markets our work requires strong econometric analysis. Given the growth of projects requiring these skills we are now looking to recruit a further Manager or Senior Manager to bolster our existing team. The scope of work you may be involved is exceptionally broad and could include estimation of complex counterfactuals, market demand forecasting, profitability analysis, estimation of default probabilities, valuation of companies, and estimation of damages alongside many other applications of econometrics.
Whilst our Economic Consulting practice is a separate operating unit that goes to market as a specialist provider, it also works closely with our market leading Financial Services Group (FSG), Public Sector Advisory (PAS) and Forensic and Investigations Services (FIS) practices. Given the nature of work in a multi-disciplinary firm, joint delivery and marketing with Directors and Partners from across the FSG, PAS and FIS practices will be a key part of this role.

A look into the role
As an Econometrician within our Economic Consulting team, you will be:
Responsible for the delivery and quality assurance of econometric work across the wide range of projects conducted across the team
Work closely with a small team of other similarly skilled team members focused on quantitative issues
Working alongside other Directors and Partners from Economic Consulting and other parts of the firm to co tribute to proposals and build relationships across the firms client base
Support the development of the economic consulting practice and its team members, potentially undertaking training and people management roles to support the development of less experienced team members.
Knowing you’re right for us
Joining us as an Econometrician, the minimum criteria is experience of using econometrics across a wide range of issues. However, your experience may have been more focused on a specific use of econometrics previously and want to expand that scope. It would be great if you had some of the following skills, but don't worry if you don't tick every box, we'll help you develop along the way.
Educated to a post graduate level as an economist, holding a PhD or an MSC with a substantial econometric component.
Whilst heavily in nature you must have the ability to explain your work to an informed but non specialist audience.
Substantial experience obtained from working within one or more of an economics consultancy, commercial firms, Government or regulatory authority.
Knowing we’re right for you
Embracing uniqueness, the culture at Grant Thornton thrives on the contributions of all our people, we never settle for what is easy, we look beyond to deliver the right thing, for everyone. Building an inclusive culture, where we value difference and respect our colleagues helps our people to perform at the best of their ability and realise their potential.

Providing valuation advice about anything from large public companies to patents and trademarks. We do all types of work, but in particular we are the leading firm in advising on valuation issues before courts and tribunals all around the world; and

Who are we?
We're Mediahub. A growing global media agency built specifically for challenger brands looking to challenge the status quo.
It is our secret sauce – media creativity – that truly differentiates us.

Although part of the MullenLowe Group, we are powered by IPG's Mediabrands and have access to all the resources, intelligence, and buying power associated with the largest media companies, but remain small enough to provide clients with our best people and move with great alacrity.

It's a fantastic opportunity to build a modern econometric proposition within an agency which believes in the challenger mindset whilst building on existing award winning work!
You will also be responsible for methodology and model selection and will work closely with our data engineer with regards to the agency's data infrastructure systems built on the AWS stack which we use to warehouse data suitable for modelling. You will also be the go to data technologist for our clients providing recommendations and roadmapping econometric solutions to answer questions and offer pivotal insight.

About you
This specialist senior role will suit candidates with a strong interest in unleashing the power of econometrics in the team and a demonstrable background in econometrics. The role offers those who are familiar with econometrics an opportunity to build our econometrics product, incorporating the latest thinking and to be pivotal in building super cool applications using ML such as our award winning NBD tool on our website as an example.
At Mediahub we believe that people are what make great places to work. We believe in meritocracy, and that hard work and star quality should get rewarded. You will need to be ready to hit the ground running, and looking to now do the best work of your career. If so, we'd look forward to meeting you.

At Symmetry Investments, we seek to engage in intelligent risk-taking to create value for our clients, partners and employees. We derive our edge from our capacity to generate Win-Wins – in the broadest sense. Win-Win is our fundamental ethical and strategic principle. By generating Win-Wins, we can create unique solutions that reconcile perspectives that are usually seen as incompatible or opposites, and encompass the best that each side has to offer:
We integrate fixed-income arbitrage with global macro strategies in a novel way.
We invent and develop technology that focuses on the potential of human-machine integration.
We build systems where machines do what they do best, supporting people to do what people do best.
We are creating a collaborative meritocracy: a culture where individual contribution serves both personal and collective goals - and is rewarded accordingly.
We value both ownership thinking AND cooperative team spirit, self-realization AND community.

Job Description

We are seeking a candidate for a Quantitative Macro Researcher position focusing on inflation markets of developed countries. The position is within the Quantitative Macro Research team responsible for developing tools to analyse macro economic developments as well as identify opportunities in fixed income and FX markets.

Your role will include developing discretionary frameworks and quantitative models. You will also conduct thematic and ad-hoc research when necessary. You will use these frameworks to recommend practical investment opportunities. Specific focus will be on the UK market, initially. In addition, you will implement your models within our technology systems as well as visualise research output. You will create processes and tests to ensure robust implementation of the models, data used and processes to run these models. You should be hands on to be able to work with data, implement models and deliver results. You will be consulting with other researchers and interacting with developers on performing the analysis, prototyping a solution and automating research workflow.

We value interest and capabilities, entrepreneurial spirit as much as formal experience. Academic credentials are not a requirement if you can demonstrate your skills and added value. You will be working in a creative, less-structured environment, with a degree of autonomy to implement solutions. You will be able to think about problems in a high-level way using pragmatically common sense. You are comfortable asking for help when you need it. You are capable of accepting direction should a particular solution fit with the longer-term strategic goals of the firm.

What work will the successful candidate do in the first 3-6 months
Work on existing frameworks for the discretionary and quantitative valuation of inflation
bottom up and top down models of inflation
leading indicators
fixing analysis
Develop new tools to identify developments in inflation markets
Monitor macroeconomic developments, identify trends
Specific macro focus will be on UK inflation including modelling of RPI indices
Recommend trade ideas in inflation markets to Portfolio Management team
Implement quantitative frameworks within the technology infrastructure of the firm; work on visualisation tools to ensure that the output of the created models is distributed within the firm
Requirements
Practical knowledge of inflation markets, key drivers, valuation frameworks
Experience with the UK market (RPI) is a plus. Candidates who lack this experience are still encouraged to apply as we provide specific market training
Excellent problem solving and diagnostic skills
Understanding of financial economics, knowledge of statistics / econometrics
Curiosity and confidence in supporting new technologies, software, programming languages
Knowledge of at least of one programming language (Julia, Python, Matlab, D, other)

You will need to show us examples of any publicly-shareable code that you’ve written (hobby projects, open source contributions). A link to your GitHub would help expedite the selection process.
What to Expect from our Interview Process
Our interview process is not a cookie cutter process and changes based on the candidate. In general, you should expect:

- An introductory meeting and an aptitude assessment. The aptitude assessment is not a pass/fail test, and we do the same aptitude assessment for all candidates coming to Symmetry - so it cannot be a test of competency for a certain role. We're trying to understand what you're good at and what you're bad at, to try to form a role around your strengths and weaknesses.

A meeting with a member of the team for an open discussion on your background, experiences and how you may fit into the team.

A meeting with someone technical. We're not looking for everyone to be a software developer, but we do like having technical people meet candidates to see how they approach complex problems, how they can break them down and solve them, and how they learn.

Iteration from there, based on the feedback from the interviews and any further interviews to try to figure out where you'd best fit within Symmetry and what role we can create for you.

With frequent events, workshops, giveaways, slack coffee and donut sessions we have definitely brought on our office culture to this new virtual world of zoom calls.
We also try to cater for all our staff’s needs – be that a freshly brewed cappuccino made by our professional barista in our free coffee shop or by providing a bountiful supply of tasty snacks to keep us refueled and buzzing.
We love to organise plenty of social get-togethers and action-packed activity days, be it slipping inside an inflatable bumper ball for a mad session of football zorbing or throwing caution to the wind and traversing giddy treetop rope courses at Go Ape. On top of these team-building activities, our lunch and learn workshops, not to mention the lavish Christmas and summer parties, foster that ‘work hard, play hard’ mantra. Our offices are based in the heart of the metropolises of London and Lviv, surrounded by an abundance of diversity and inspiration to keep those ideas flowing.

More than you expected
Grant Thornton UK LLP is part of a global network of independent audit, tax and advisory firms, made up of some 58,000 people in over 135 countries. We're a team of independent thinkers who put quality, inclusion and integrity first. All around the world we bring a different experience to our clients. A better experience. One that delivers the expertise they need in a way that goes beyond. Personal, proactive, and agile. That's Grant Thornton.
Job Description:
NEW GROUND WON’T BREAK ITSELF.
Every day our teams help people in businesses and communities to do what is right and achieve their goals.
Grant Thornton is making major investment in the formation of Grant Thornton Economic Consulting - providing specialist economic advice across all our legal, corporate and public sector clients. Frequently working alongside colleagues from across Grant Thornton, we advise on high profile issues in all major sectors of the economy.
Our Economic Consulting team works across three markets:
The legal market providing expert economic analysis to High Courts, International Arbitration Hearings and Competition Courts across a wide range of cases and settings
The public sector market providing advice to Governments, regulatory agencies and related agencies on policy and financing issues
The private sector market on a wide range of regulatory strategic and transactional issues.
In each of these markets our work requires strong econometric analysis. Given the growth of projects requiring these skills we are now looking to recruit a further Manager or Senior Manager to bolster our existing team. The scope of work you may be involved is exceptionally broad and could include estimation of complex counterfactuals, market demand forecasting, profitability analysis, estimation of default probabilities, valuation of companies, and estimation of damages alongside many other applications of econometrics.
Whilst our Economic Consulting practice is a separate operating unit that goes to market as a specialist provider, it also works closely with our market leading Financial Services Group (FSG), Public Sector Advisory (PAS) and Forensic and Investigations Services (FIS) practices. Given the nature of work in a multi-disciplinary firm, joint delivery and marketing with Directors and Partners from across the FSG, PAS and FIS practices will be a key part of this role.
We’re happy to talk flexible working and consider reduced hours and job shares, we’ll support you to balance your work and life.
A look into the role
As an Econometrician within our Economic Consulting team, you will be:
Responsible for the delivery and quality assurance of econometric work across the wide range of projects conducted across the team
Work closely with a small team of other similarly skilled team members focused on quantitative issues
Working alongside other Directors and Partners from Economic Consulting and other parts of the firm to co tribute to proposals and build relationships across the firms client base
Support the development of the economic consulting practice and its team members, potentially undertaking training and people management roles to support the development of less experienced team members.
Knowing you’re right for us
Joining us as an Econometrician, the minimum criteria is experience of using econometrics across a wide range of issues. However, your experience may have been more focused on a specific use of econometrics previously and want to expand that scope. It would be great if you had some of the following skills, but don't worry if you don't tick every box, we'll help you develop along the way.
Educated to a post graduate level as an economist, holding a PhD or an MSC with a substantial econometric component.
Whilst heavily in nature you must have the ability to explain your work to an informed but non specialist audience.
Substantial experience obtained from working within one or more of an economics consultancy, commercial firms, Government or regulatory authority.
Knowing we’re right for you
Embracing uniqueness, the culture at Grant Thornton thrives on the contributions of all our people, we never settle for what is easy, we look beyond to deliver the right thing, for everyone. Building an inclusive culture, where we value difference and respect our colleagues helps our people to perform at the best of their ability and realise their potential.
Our open and accessible culture means you’ll interact with leaders who are interested in you and everything you bring to our firm. The things that set you apart, we value them. That’s why we give you the freedom to bring your whole self to work and pursue your passions inside and outside of work.
Beyond the job
Life is more than work. The things you do, and the people you’re with outside of work matter, that’s why we’re happy to look at flexible working options for all our roles, and we’ll always do our best to keep your work and life in balance.
The impact you can make here will go far beyond your day job. From secondments, to fundraising for local charities, or investing in entrepreneurs in the developing world, you’ll be giving back to society. It’s that drive to do the right thing that runs through our every move, grounded in our CLEARR values – Collaboration, Leadership, Excellence, Agility, Respect and Responsibility.
We’re looking for people who want to contribute, spark fresh ideas and go beyond expectations. People who want to be able to proudly do what’s right, for the firm, our clients, our people and themselves. It’s how it should be.

Who are we?
We're Mediahub. A growing global media agency built specifically for challenger brands looking to challenge the status quo.
It is our secret sauce – media creativity – that truly differentiates us. In a world with more ad blockers and ad-free environments, ever greater media fragmentation and growing attention scarcity, not all impressions are equal. We believe this makes creativity the most powerful economic multiplier any media agency can leverage and is a critical ingredient for challenger brands seeking an unfair share of attention.
Although part of the MullenLowe Group, we are powered by IPG's Mediabrands and have access to all the resources, intelligence, and buying power associated with the largest media companies, but remain small enough to provide clients with our best people and move with great alacrity.

What will you do?
As our Econometrician, you will be responsible for the end to end modelling process from technical specification, development, delivery and maintenance and updates of models for our clients.
It's a fantastic opportunity to build a modern econometric proposition within an agency which believes in the challenger mindset whilst building on existing award winning work!
You will also be responsible for methodology and model selection and will work closely with our data engineer with regards to the agency's data infrastructure systems built on the AWS stack which we use to warehouse data suitable for modelling. You will also be the go to data technologist for our clients providing recommendations and roadmapping econometric solutions to answer questions and offer pivotal insight.

About you
This specialist senior role will suit candidates with a strong interest in unleashing the power of econometrics in the team and a demonstrable background in econometrics. The role offers those who are familiar with econometrics an opportunity to build our econometrics product, incorporating the latest thinking and to be pivotal in building super cool applications using ML such as our award winning NBD tool on our website as an example.
At Mediahub we believe that people are what make great places to work. We believe in meritocracy, and that hard work and star quality should get rewarded. You will need to be ready to hit the ground running, and looking to now do the best work of your career. If so, we'd look forward to meeting you.

Benefits
Extra holiday days you can buy, your birthday off, gym discounts, a running club, healthcare, discounted massages and just about everything else you can think of! Dedicated to our people, we provide extensive benefits to help with that work life balance. We focus on great people, great work, effectiveness, creativity and passion. If that sounds like the place for you then we want to meet you!
Mediahub is an equal opportunity employer. We celebrate diversity and are committed to creating an inclusive environment for all employees.

Symmetry Investments is a global investment company with offices in Hong Kong, Singapore, London, Jersey and Cayman Islands. We have been in business since 2014 after successfully spinning off from a major New York-based hedge fund.

At Symmetry Investments, we seek to engage in intelligent risk-taking to create value for our clients, partners and employees. We derive our edge from our capacity to generate Win-Wins – in the broadest sense. Win-Win is our fundamental ethical and strategic principle. By generating Win-Wins, we can create unique solutions that reconcile perspectives that are usually seen as incompatible or opposites, and encompass the best that each side has to offer:
We integrate fixed-income arbitrage with global macro strategies in a novel way.
We invent and develop technology that focuses on the potential of human-machine integration.
We build systems where machines do what they do best, supporting people to do what people do best.
We are creating a collaborative meritocracy: a culture where individual contribution serves both personal and collective goals - and is rewarded accordingly.
We value both ownership thinking AND cooperative team spirit, self-realization AND community.

Job Description

We are seeking a candidate for a Quantitative Macro Researcher position focusing on inflation markets of developed countries. The position is within the Quantitative Macro Research team responsible for developing tools to analyse macro economic developments as well as identify opportunities in fixed income and FX markets.

Your role will include developing discretionary frameworks and quantitative models. You will also conduct thematic and ad-hoc research when necessary. You will use these frameworks to recommend practical investment opportunities. Specific focus will be on the UK market, initially. In addition, you will implement your models within our technology systems as well as visualise research output. You will create processes and tests to ensure robust implementation of the models, data used and processes to run these models. You should be hands on to be able to work with data, implement models and deliver results. You will be consulting with other researchers and interacting with developers on performing the analysis, prototyping a solution and automating research workflow.

We value interest and capabilities, entrepreneurial spirit as much as formal experience. Academic credentials are not a requirement if you can demonstrate your skills and added value. You will be working in a creative, less-structured environment, with a degree of autonomy to implement solutions. You will be able to think about problems in a high-level way using pragmatically common sense. You are comfortable asking for help when you need it. You are capable of accepting direction should a particular solution fit with the longer-term strategic goals of the firm.

What work will the successful candidate do in the first 3-6 months
Work on existing frameworks for the discretionary and quantitative valuation of inflation
bottom up and top down models of inflation
leading indicators
fixing analysis
Develop new tools to identify developments in inflation markets
Monitor macroeconomic developments, identify trends
Specific macro focus will be on UK inflation including modelling of RPI indices
Recommend trade ideas in inflation markets to Portfolio Management team
Implement quantitative frameworks within the technology infrastructure of the firm; work on visualisation tools to ensure that the output of the created models is distributed within the firm
Requirements
Practical knowledge of inflation markets, key drivers, valuation frameworks
Experience with the UK market (RPI) is a plus. Candidates who lack this experience are still encouraged to apply as we provide specific market training
Excellent problem solving and diagnostic skills
Understanding of financial economics, knowledge of statistics / econometrics
Curiosity and confidence in supporting new technologies, software, programming languages
Knowledge of at least of one programming language (Julia, Python, Matlab, D, other)
Ability to work under pressure and able to prioritize work
Highly detail oriented, self-directed, entrepreneurial and keen to learn
Exceptional verbal and written communication skills
Ability to present complex research outcomes with clarity and brevity

You will need to show us examples of any publicly-shareable code that you’ve written (hobby projects, open source contributions). A link to your GitHub would help expedite the selection process.
What to Expect from our Interview Process
Our interview process is not a cookie cutter process and changes based on the candidate. In general, you should expect:

- An introductory meeting and an aptitude assessment. The aptitude assessment is not a pass/fail test, and we do the same aptitude assessment for all candidates coming to Symmetry - so it cannot be a test of competency for a certain role. We're trying to understand what you're good at and what you're bad at, to try to form a role around your strengths and weaknesses.

A meeting with a member of the team for an open discussion on your background, experiences and how you may fit into the team.

A meeting with someone technical. We're not looking for everyone to be a software developer, but we do like having technical people meet candidates to see how they approach complex problems, how they can break them down and solve them, and how they learn.

Iteration from there, based on the feedback from the interviews and any further interviews to try to figure out where you'd best fit within Symmetry and what role we can create for you.

How you split your time will depend on the meetings in your diary, projects you may be working on, the time of the role etc - we want you to be able to embrace the flexibility while thinking about what works best for The Company, Your clients and You. In addition we provide 28 days annual leave with the option to purchase an additional 10.

Frontier is entirely owned by its employees. As Shareholders, we encourage everyone to put forward their views. Not only do we influence how the company is run but we choose to distribute as much of our profits as is prudently possible through bonuses. In addition we offer a highly rewarding salary.

More than you expected
Grant Thornton UK LLP is part of a global network of independent audit, tax and advisory firms, made up of some 58,000 people in over 135 countries. We're a team of independent thinkers who put quality, inclusion and integrity first. All around the world we bring a different experience to our clients. A better experience. One that delivers the expertise they need in a way that goes beyond. Personal, proactive, and agile. That's Grant Thornton.
Job Description:
NEW GROUND WON’T BREAK ITSELF.
Every day our teams help people in businesses and communities to do what is right and achieve their goals.
Grant Thornton is making major investment in the formation of Grant Thornton Economic Consulting - providing specialist economic advice across all our legal, corporate and public sector clients. Frequently working alongside colleagues from across Grant Thornton, we advise on high profile issues in all major sectors of the economy.
Our Economic Consulting team works across three markets:
The legal market providing expert economic analysis to High Courts, International Arbitration Hearings and Competition Courts across a wide range of cases and settings
The public sector market providing advice to Governments, regulatory agencies and related agencies on policy and financing issues
The private sector market on a wide range of regulatory strategic and transactional issues.
In each of these markets our work requires strong econometric analysis. Given the growth of projects requiring these skills we are now looking to recruit a further Manager or Senior Manager to bolster our existing team. The scope of work you may be involved is exceptionally broad and could include estimation of complex counterfactuals, market demand forecasting, profitability analysis, estimation of default probabilities, valuation of companies, and estimation of damages alongside many other applications of econometrics.
Whilst our Economic Consulting practice is a separate operating unit that goes to market as a specialist provider, it also works closely with our market leading Financial Services Group (FSG), Public Sector Advisory (PAS) and Forensic and Investigations Services (FIS) practices. Given the nature of work in a multi-disciplinary firm, joint delivery and marketing with Directors and Partners from across the FSG, PAS and FIS practices will be a key part of this role.
We’re happy to talk flexible working and consider reduced hours and job shares, we’ll support you to balance your work and life.
A look into the role
As an Econometrician within our Economic Consulting team, you will be:
Responsible for the delivery and quality assurance of econometric work across the wide range of projects conducted across the team
Work closely with a small team of other similarly skilled team members focused on quantitative issues
Working alongside other Directors and Partners from Economic Consulting and other parts of the firm to co tribute to proposals and build relationships across the firms client base
Support the development of the economic consulting practice and its team members, potentially undertaking training and people management roles to support the development of less experienced team members.
Knowing you’re right for us
Joining us as an Econometrician, the minimum criteria is experience of using econometrics across a wide range of issues. However, your experience may have been more focused on a specific use of econometrics previously and want to expand that scope. It would be great if you had some of the following skills, but don't worry if you don't tick every box, we'll help you develop along the way.
Educated to a post graduate level as an economist, holding a PhD or an MSC with a substantial econometric component.
Whilst heavily in nature you must have the ability to explain your work to an informed but non specialist audience.
Substantial experience obtained from working within one or more of an economics consultancy, commercial firms, Government or regulatory authority.
Knowing we’re right for you
Embracing uniqueness, the culture at Grant Thornton thrives on the contributions of all our people, we never settle for what is easy, we look beyond to deliver the right thing, for everyone. Building an inclusive culture, where we value difference and respect our colleagues helps our people to perform at the best of their ability and realise their potential.
Our open and accessible culture means you’ll interact with leaders who are interested in you and everything you bring to our firm. The things that set you apart, we value them. That’s why we give you the freedom to bring your whole self to work and pursue your passions inside and outside of work.

Life is more than work. The things you do, and the people you’re with outside of work matter, that’s why we’re happy to look at flexible working options for all our roles, and we’ll always do our best to keep your work and life in balance.
The impact you can make here will go far beyond your day job.

This could lead to an offer of a graduate role. You will gain access to many experts and professionals to grow your network, including senior leaders. We are seeking students from a variety of degrees.

Our team of consultants come from a wide variety for academic backgrounds. At FTI they develop skills in economics and finance as well as drawing on their problem solving and analytical skills to answer a range of questions for high-profile clients.

We specialise in two main areas:
Providing valuation advice about anything from large public companies to patents and trademarks. We do all types of work, but in particular we are the leading firm in advising on valuation issues before courts and tribunals all around the world; and
Economic regulatory advice, where we apply economic theory and in-depth experience to offer advice to both regulators and regulated companies on a wide range of issues.

We have offices in cities across the world, with more than 250 staff worldwide. In London, our EFC practice has more than 150 people and each year we look to recruit at least 15 graduates from any degree background.

Examples of the questions our clients ask us
What impact did Uber have on the earnings of Black Cab drivers in London?
What is a fair way to distribute money to artists from steaming service royalties?
How much extra cost did the NHS incur because a generic drug was kept off the UK market by an invalid patent?
How much is the brand name of a premiership football club worth?
What is the value of an airport in South Africa?
Do US stock exchanges undervalue Chinese companies?
As part of the Foskett Panel, how much compensation should business owners receive after they were wrongly made to close by Lloyds Bank?
Does an econometric analysis of a European bank's share price indicate that it was affected by the release of inside information?
How large are the benefits of subsidising rural broadband networks in Europe?



What You Will Do
Our project teams perform industry research and develop the knowledge and experience to perform detailed economic analysis and financial modelling to solve interesting questions. They benefit significantly from working closely with managers and other team members in small teams, as well as from direct exposure to some of the top experts in the industry.

What We Offer You

Delivering incisive interpretation of complex economic issues has made us a global leader in this field. Our team includes economists, accountants, valuation professionals, MBAs and econometricians.

We work on varied and challenging assignments across a wide spectrum of industries and contexts. In particular:

In financial services, we develop, review and implement strategies for the management of market and credit risks, liquidity and operational risk, litigation exposure and regulatory compliance.
In regulated industries, we use economic analysis, econometrics and network modelling to analyse pricing issues and we advise companies and government agencies on the effect of proposed policies.

Who are we?
We're Mediahub. A growing global media agency built specifically for challenger brands looking to challenge the status quo.
It is our secret sauce – media creativity – that truly differentiates us. In a world with more ad blockers and ad-free environments, ever greater media fragmentation and growing attention scarcity, not all impressions are equal. We believe this makes creativity the most powerful economic multiplier any media agency can leverage and is a critical ingredient for challenger brands seeking an unfair share of attention.
Although part of the MullenLowe Group, we are powered by IPG's Mediabrands and have access to all the resources, intelligence, and buying power associated with the largest media companies, but remain small enough to provide clients with our best people and move with great alacrity.

As our Econometrician, you will be responsible for the end to end modelling process from technical specification, development, delivery and maintenance and updates of models for our clients.
It's a fantastic opportunity to build a modern econometric proposition within an agency which believes in the challenger mindset whilst building on existing award winning work!
You will also be responsible for methodology and model selection and will work closely with our data engineer with regards to the agency's data infrastructure systems built on the AWS stack which we use to warehouse data suitable for modelling. You will also be the go to data technologist for our clients providing recommendations and roadmapping econometric solutions to answer questions and offer pivotal insight.

About you
This specialist senior role will suit candidates with a strong interest in unleashing the power of econometrics in the team and a demonstrable background in econometrics. The role offers those who are familiar with econometrics an opportunity to build our econometrics product, incorporating the latest thinking and to be pivotal in building super cool applications using ML such as our award winning NBD tool on our website as an example.
At Mediahub we believe that people are what make great places to work. We believe in meritocracy, and that hard work and star quality should get rewarded. You will need to be ready to hit the ground running, and looking to now do the best work of your career. If so, we'd look forward to meeting you.

At Symmetry Investments, we seek to engage in intelligent risk-taking to create value for our clients, partners and employees. We derive our edge from our capacity to generate Win-Wins – in the broadest sense. Win-Win is our fundamental ethical and strategic principle. By generating Win-Wins, we can create unique solutions that reconcile perspectives that are usually seen as incompatible or opposites, and encompass the best that each side has to offer:
We integrate fixed-income arbitrage with global macro strategies in a novel way.
We invent and develop technology that focuses on the potential of human-machine integration.
We build systems where machines do what they do best, supporting people to do what people do best.
We are creating a collaborative meritocracy: a culture where individual contribution serves both personal and collective goals - and is rewarded accordingly.
We value both ownership thinking AND cooperative team spirit, self-realization AND community.

Job Description

We are seeking a candidate for a Quantitative Macro Researcher position focusing on inflation markets of developed countries. The position is within the Quantitative Macro Research team responsible for developing tools to analyse macro economic developments as well as identify opportunities in fixed income and FX markets.

Your role will include developing discretionary frameworks and quantitative models. You will also conduct thematic and ad-hoc research when necessary. You will use these frameworks to recommend practical investment opportunities. Specific focus will be on the UK market, initially. In addition, you will implement your models within our technology systems as well as visualise research output. You will create processes and tests to ensure robust implementation of the models, data used and processes to run these models. You should be hands on to be able to work with data, implement models and deliver results. You will be consulting with other researchers and interacting with developers on performing the analysis, prototyping a solution and automating research workflow.

We value interest and capabilities, entrepreneurial spirit as much as formal experience. Academic credentials are not a requirement if you can demonstrate your skills and added value. You will be working in a creative, less-structured environment, with a degree of autonomy to implement solutions. You will be able to think about problems in a high-level way using pragmatically common sense. You are comfortable asking for help when you need it. You are capable of accepting direction should a particular solution fit with the longer-term strategic goals of the firm.

What work will the successful candidate do in the first 3-6 months
Work on existing frameworks for the discretionary and quantitative valuation of inflation
bottom up and top down models of inflation
leading indicators
fixing analysis
Develop new tools to identify developments in inflation markets
Monitor macroeconomic developments, identify trends
Specific macro focus will be on UK inflation including modelling of RPI indices
Recommend trade ideas in inflation markets to Portfolio Management team
Implement quantitative frameworks within the technology infrastructure of the firm; work on visualisation tools to ensure that the output of the created models is distributed within the firm
Requirements
Practical knowledge of inflation markets, key drivers, valuation frameworks
Experience with the UK market (RPI) is a plus. Candidates who lack this experience are still encouraged to apply as we provide specific market training
Excellent problem solving and diagnostic skills
Understanding of financial economics, knowledge of statistics / econometrics
Curiosity and confidence in supporting new technologies, software, programming languages
Knowledge of at least of one programming language (Julia, Python, Matlab, D, other)
Ability to work under pressure and able to prioritize work
Highly detail oriented, self-directed, entrepreneurial and keen to learn
Exceptional verbal and written communication skills
Ability to present complex research outcomes with clarity and brevity

You will need to show us examples of any publicly-shareable code that you’ve written (hobby projects, open source contributions). A link to your GitHub would help expedite the selection process.
What to Expect from our Interview Process
Our interview process is not a cookie cutter process and changes based on the candidate. In general, you should expect:

- An introductory meeting and an aptitude assessment. The aptitude assessment is not a pass/fail test, and we do the same aptitude assessment for all candidates coming to Symmetry - so it cannot be a test of competency for a certain role. We're trying to understand what you're good at and what you're bad at, to try to form a role around your strengths and weaknesses.

A meeting with a member of the team for an open discussion on your background, experiences and how you may fit into the team.

A meeting with someone technical. We're not looking for everyone to be a software developer, but we do like having technical people meet candidates to see how they approach complex problems, how they can break them down and solve them, and how they learn.

Iteration from there, based on the feedback from the interviews and any further interviews to try to figure out where you'd best fit within Symmetry and what role we can create for you.

More than you expected
Grant Thornton UK LLP is part of a global network of independent audit, tax and advisory firms, made up of some 58,000 people in over 135 countries. We're a team of independent thinkers who put quality, inclusion and integrity first. All around the world we bring a different experience to our clients. A better experience. One that delivers the expertise they need in a way that goes beyond. Personal, proactive, and agile. That's Grant Thornton.
Job Description:
NEW GROUND WON’T BREAK ITSELF.
Every day our teams help people in businesses and communities to do what is right and achieve their goals.
Grant Thornton is making major investment in the formation of Grant Thornton Economic Consulting - providing specialist economic advice across all our legal, corporate and public sector clients. Frequently working alongside colleagues from across Grant Thornton, we advise on high profile issues in all major sectors of the economy.
Our Economic Consulting team works across three markets:
The legal market providing expert economic analysis to High Courts, International Arbitration Hearings and Competition Courts across a wide range of cases and settings
The public sector market providing advice to Governments, regulatory agencies and related agencies on policy and financing issues
The private sector market on a wide range of regulatory strategic and transactional issues.
In each of these markets our work requires strong econometric analysis. Given the growth of projects requiring these skills we are now looking to recruit a further Manager or Senior Manager to bolster our existing team. The scope of work you may be involved is exceptionally broad and could include estimation of complex counterfactuals, market demand forecasting, profitability analysis, estimation of default probabilities, valuation of companies, and estimation of damages alongside many other applications of econometrics.
Whilst our Economic Consulting practice is a separate operating unit that goes to market as a specialist provider, it also works closely with our market leading Financial Services Group (FSG), Public Sector Advisory (PAS) and Forensic and Investigations Services (FIS) practices. Given the nature of work in a multi-disciplinary firm, joint delivery and marketing with Directors and Partners from across the FSG, PAS and FIS practices will be a key part of this role.
We’re happy to talk flexible working and consider reduced hours and job shares, we’ll support you to balance your work and life.
A look into the role
As an Econometrician within our Economic Consulting team, you will be:
Responsible for the delivery and quality assurance of econometric work across the wide range of projects conducted across the team
Work closely with a small team of other similarly skilled team members focused on quantitative issues
Working alongside other Directors and Partners from Economic Consulting and other parts of the firm to co tribute to proposals and build relationships across the firms client base
Support the development of the economic consulting practice and its team members, potentially undertaking training and people management roles to support the development of less experienced team members.
Knowing you’re right for us
Joining us as an Econometrician, the minimum criteria is experience of using econometrics across a wide range of issues. However, your experience may have been more focused on a specific use of econometrics previously and want to expand that scope. It would be great if you had some of the following skills, but don't worry if you don't tick every box, we'll help you develop along the way.
Educated to a post graduate level as an economist, holding a PhD or an MSC with a substantial econometric component.
Whilst heavily in nature you must have the ability to explain your work to an informed but non specialist audience.
Substantial experience obtained from working within one or more of an economics consultancy, commercial firms, Government or regulatory authority.
Knowing we’re right for you
Embracing uniqueness, the culture at Grant Thornton thrives on the contributions of all our people, we never settle for what is easy, we look beyond to deliver the right thing, for everyone. Building an inclusive culture, where we value difference and respect our colleagues helps our people to perform at the best of their ability and realise their potential.
Our open and accessible culture means you’ll interact with leaders who are interested in you and everything you bring to our firm. The things that set you apart, we value them. That’s why we give you the freedom to bring your whole self to work and pursue your passions inside and outside of work.
Beyond the job
Life is more than work. The things you do, and the people you’re with outside of work matter, that’s why we’re happy to look at flexible working options for all our roles, and we’ll always do our best to keep your work and life in balance.
The impact you can make here will go far beyond your day job. From secondments, to fundraising for local charities, or investing in entrepreneurs in the developing world, you’ll be giving back to society. It’s that drive to do the right thing that runs through our every move, grounded in our CLEARR values – Collaboration, Leadership, Excellence, Agility, Respect and Responsibility.
We’re looking for people who want to contribute, spark fresh ideas and go beyond expectations. People who want to be able to proudly do what’s right, for the firm, our clients, our people and themselves. It’s how it should be.

Who are we?
We're Mediahub. A growing global media agency built specifically for challenger brands looking to challenge the status quo.
It is our secret sauce – media creativity – that truly differentiates us. In a world with more ad blockers and ad-free environments, ever greater media fragmentation and growing attention scarcity, not all impressions are equal. We believe this makes creativity the most powerful economic multiplier any media agency can leverage and is a critical ingredient for challenger brands seeking an unfair share of attention.
Although part of the MullenLowe Group, we are powered by IPG's Mediabrands and have access to all the resources, intelligence, and buying power associated with the largest media companies, but remain small enough to provide clients with our best people and move with great alacrity.

What will you do?
As our Econometrician, you will be responsible for the end to end modelling process from technical specification, development, delivery and maintenance and updates of models for our clients.
It's a fantastic opportunity to build a modern econometric proposition within an agency which believes in the challenger mindset whilst building on existing award winning work!
You will also be responsible for methodology and model selection and will work closely with our data engineer with regards to the agency's data infrastructure systems built on the AWS stack which we use to warehouse data suitable for modelling. You will also be the go to data technologist for our clients providing recommendations and roadmapping econometric solutions to answer questions and offer pivotal insight.

About you
This specialist senior role will suit candidates with a strong interest in unleashing the power of econometrics in the team and a demonstrable background in econometrics. The role offers those who are familiar with econometrics an opportunity to build our econometrics product, incorporating the latest thinking and to be pivotal in building super cool applications using ML such as our award winning NBD tool on our website as an example.
At Mediahub we believe that people are what make great places to work. We believe in meritocracy, and that hard work and star quality should get rewarded. You will need to be ready to hit the ground running, and looking to now do the best work of your career. If so, we'd look forward to meeting you.

Benefits
Extra holiday days you can buy, your birthday off, gym discounts, a running club, healthcare, discounted massages and just about everything else you can think of! Dedicated to our people, we provide extensive benefits to help with that work life balance. We focus on great people, great work, effectiveness, creativity and passion. If that sounds like the place for you then we want to meet you!
Mediahub is an equal opportunity employer. We celebrate diversity and are committed to creating an inclusive environment for all employees.

At Symmetry Investments, we seek to engage in intelligent risk-taking to create value for our clients, partners and employees. We derive our edge from our capacity to generate Win-Wins – in the broadest sense. Win-Win is our fundamental ethical and strategic principle. By generating Win-Wins, we can create unique solutions that reconcile perspectives that are usually seen as incompatible or opposites, and encompass the best that each side has to offer:
We integrate fixed-income arbitrage with global macro strategies in a novel way.
We invent and develop technology that focuses on the potential of human-machine integration.
We build systems where machines do what they do best, supporting people to do what people do best.

You will create processes and tests to ensure robust implementation of the models, data used and processes to run these models. You should be hands on to be able to work with data, implement models and deliver results. You will be consulting with other researchers and interacting with developers on performing the analysis, prototyping a solution and automating research workflow.

We value interest and capabilities, entrepreneurial spirit as much as formal experience. Academic credentials are not a requirement if you can demonstrate your skills and added value. You will be working in a creative, less-structured environment, with a degree of autonomy to implement solutions. You will be able to think about problems in a high-level way using pragmatically common sense. You are comfortable asking for help when you need it. You are capable of accepting direction should a particular solution fit with the longer-term strategic goals of the firm.

What work will the successful candidate do in the first 3-6 months
Work on existing frameworks for the discretionary and quantitative valuation of inflation
bottom up and top down models of inflation
leading indicators
fixing analysis

You will need to show us examples of any publicly-shareable code that you’ve written (hobby projects, open source contributions). A link to your GitHub would help expedite the selection process.
What to Expect from our Interview Process
Our interview process is not a cookie cutter process and changes based on the candidate. In general, you should expect:

- An introductory meeting and an aptitude assessment. The aptitude assessment is not a pass/fail test, and we do the same aptitude assessment for all candidates coming to Symmetry - so it cannot be a test of competency for a certain role. We're trying to understand what you're good at and what you're bad at, to try to form a role around your strengths and weaknesses.

A meeting with a member of the team for an open discussion on your background, experiences and how you may fit into the team.

A meeting with someone technical. We're not looking for everyone to be a software developer, but we do like having technical people meet candidates to see how they approach complex problems, how they can break them down and solve them, and how they learn.

Iteration from there, based on the feedback from the interviews and any further interviews to try to figure out where you'd best fit within Symmetry and what role we can create for you.

We are looking for talented team players, with specialised skills and valuable expertise, who have a desire to advance their career path. As a Data Scientist some of your responsibilities will include:
Accurately delivering work, helping project managers determine the type of analysis that will best answer our clients’ questions and delivering this yourself with the help of more junior colleagues.

We are encouraging a 60:40 split either way, with a full-time colleague typically being in the office 2-3 days a week. How you split your time will depend on the meetings in your diary, projects you may be working on, the time of the role etc - we want you to be able to embrace the flexibility while thinking about what works best for The Company, Your clients and You. In addition we provide 28 days annual leave with the option to purchase an additional 10.

Frontier is entirely owned by its employees. As Shareholders, we encourage everyone to put forward their views. Not only do we influence how the company is run but we choose to distribute as much of our profits as is prudently possible through bonuses. In addition we offer a highly rewarding salary.

More than you expected
Grant Thornton UK LLP is part of a global network of independent audit, tax and advisory firms, made up of some 58,000 people in over 135 countries. We're a team of independent thinkers who put quality, inclusion and integrity first. All around the world we bring a different experience to our clients. A better experience. One that delivers the expertise they need in a way that goes beyond. Personal, proactive, and agile. That's Grant Thornton.
Job Description:
NEW GROUND WON’T BREAK ITSELF.
Every day our teams help people in businesses and communities to do what is right and achieve their goals.
Grant Thornton is making major investment in the formation of Grant Thornton Economic Consulting - providing specialist economic advice across all our legal, corporate and public sector clients. Frequently working alongside colleagues from across Grant Thornton, we advise on high profile issues in all major sectors of the economy.
Our Economic Consulting team works across three markets:
The legal market providing expert economic analysis to High Courts, International Arbitration Hearings and Competition Courts across a wide range of cases and settings
The public sector market providing advice to Governments, regulatory agencies and related agencies on policy and financing issues
The private sector market on a wide range of regulatory strategic and transactional issues.
In each of these markets our work requires strong econometric analysis. Given the growth of projects requiring these skills we are now looking to recruit a further Manager or Senior Manager to bolster our existing team. The scope of work you may be involved is exceptionally broad and could include estimation of complex counterfactuals, market demand forecasting, profitability analysis, estimation of default probabilities, valuation of companies, and estimation of damages alongside many other applications of econometrics.
Whilst our Economic Consulting practice is a separate operating unit that goes to market as a specialist provider, it also works closely with our market leading Financial Services Group (FSG), Public Sector Advisory (PAS) and Forensic and Investigations Services (FIS) practices. Given the nature of work in a multi-disciplinary firm, joint delivery and marketing with Directors and Partners from across the FSG, PAS and FIS practices will be a key part of this role.
We’re happy to talk flexible working and consider reduced hours and job shares, we’ll support you to balance your work and life.
A look into the role
As an Econometrician within our Economic Consulting team, you will be:
Responsible for the delivery and quality assurance of econometric work across the wide range of projects conducted across the team
Work closely with a small team of other similarly skilled team members focused on quantitative issues
Working alongside other Directors and Partners from Economic Consulting and other parts of the firm to co tribute to proposals and build relationships across the firms client base
Support the development of the economic consulting practice and its team members, potentially undertaking training and people management roles to support the development of less experienced team members.
Knowing you’re right for us
Joining us as an Econometrician, the minimum criteria is experience of using econometrics across a wide range of issues. However, your experience may have been more focused on a specific use of econometrics previously and want to expand that scope. It would be great if you had some of the following skills, but don't worry if you don't tick every box, we'll help you develop along the way.
Educated to a post graduate level as an economist, holding a PhD or an MSC with a substantial econometric component.
Whilst heavily in nature you must have the ability to explain your work to an informed but non specialist audience.
Substantial experience obtained from working within one or more of an economics consultancy, commercial firms, Government or regulatory authority.
Knowing we’re right for you
Embracing uniqueness, the culture at Grant Thornton thrives on the contributions of all our people, we never settle for what is easy, we look beyond to deliver the right thing, for everyone. Building an inclusive culture, where we value difference and respect our colleagues helps our people to perform at the best of their ability and realise their potential.
Our open and accessible culture means you’ll interact with leaders who are interested in you and everything you bring to our firm. The things that set you apart, we value them. That’s why we give you the freedom to bring your whole self to work and pursue your passions inside and outside of work.
Beyond the job
Life is more than work. The things you do, and the people you’re with outside of work matter, that’s why we’re happy to look at flexible working options for all our roles, and we’ll always do our best to keep your work and life in balance.
The impact you can make here will go far beyond your day job. From secondments, to fundraising for local charities, or investing in entrepreneurs in the developing world, you’ll be giving back to society. It’s that drive to do the right thing that runs through our every move, grounded in our CLEARR values – Collaboration, Leadership, Excellence, Agility, Respect and Responsibility.
We’re looking for people who want to contribute, spark fresh ideas and go beyond expectations. People who want to be able to proudly do what’s right, for the firm, our clients, our people and themselves. It’s how it should be.

Who are we?
We're Mediahub. A growing global media agency built specifically for challenger brands looking to challenge the status quo.
It is our secret sauce – media creativity – that truly differentiates us. In a world with more ad blockers and ad-free environments, ever greater media fragmentation and growing attention scarcity, not all impressions are equal. We believe this makes creativity the most powerful economic multiplier any media agency can leverage and is a critical ingredient for challenger brands seeking an unfair share of attention.
Although part of the MullenLowe Group, we are powered by IPG's Mediabrands and have access to all the resources, intelligence, and buying power associated with the largest media companies, but remain small enough to provide clients with our best people and move with great alacrity.

What will you do?
As our Econometrician, you will be responsible for the end to end modelling process from technical specification, development, delivery and maintenance and updates of models for our clients.
It's a fantastic opportunity to build a modern econometric proposition within an agency which believes in the challenger mindset whilst building on existing award winning work!
You will also be responsible for methodology and model selection and will work closely with our data engineer with regards to the agency's data infrastructure systems built on the AWS stack which we use to warehouse data suitable for modelling. You will also be the go to data technologist for our clients providing recommendations and roadmapping econometric solutions to answer questions and offer pivotal insight.

About you
This specialist senior role will suit candidates with a strong interest in unleashing the power of econometrics in the team and a demonstrable background in econometrics. The role offers those who are familiar with econometrics an opportunity to build our econometrics product, incorporating the latest thinking and to be pivotal in building super cool applications using ML such as our award winning NBD tool on our website as an example.
At Mediahub we believe that people are what make great places to work. We believe in meritocracy, and that hard work and star quality should get rewarded. You will need to be ready to hit the ground running, and looking to now do the best work of your career. If so, we'd look forward to meeting you.

Benefits
Extra holiday days you can buy, your birthday off, gym discounts, a running club, healthcare, discounted massages and just about everything else you can think of! Dedicated to our people, we provide extensive benefits to help with that work life balance. We focus on great people, great work, effectiveness, creativity and passion. If that sounds like the place for you then we want to meet you!

At Symmetry Investments, we seek to engage in intelligent risk-taking to create value for our clients, partners and employees. We derive our edge from our capacity to generate Win-Wins – in the broadest sense. Win-Win is our fundamental ethical and strategic principle. By generating Win-Wins, we can create unique solutions that reconcile perspectives that are usually seen as incompatible or opposites, and encompass the best that each side has to offer:
We integrate fixed-income arbitrage with global macro strategies in a novel way.
We invent and develop technology that focuses on the potential of human-machine integration.
We build systems where machines do what they do best, supporting people to do what people do best.
We are creating a collaborative meritocracy: a culture where individual contribution serves both personal and collective goals - and is rewarded accordingly.
We value both ownership thinking AND cooperative team spirit, self-realization AND community.

Job Description

We are seeking a candidate for a Quantitative Macro Researcher position focusing on inflation markets of developed countries. The position is within the Quantitative Macro Research team responsible for developing tools to analyse macro economic developments as well as identify opportunities in fixed income and FX markets.

Your role will include developing discretionary frameworks and quantitative models. You will also conduct thematic and ad-hoc research when necessary. You will use these frameworks to recommend practical investment opportunities. Specific focus will be on the UK market, initially. In addition, you will implement your models within our technology systems as well as visualise research output. You will create processes and tests to ensure robust implementation of the models, data used and processes to run these models. You should be hands on to be able to work with data, implement models and deliver results. You will be consulting with other researchers and interacting with developers on performing the analysis, prototyping a solution and automating research workflow.

We value interest and capabilities, entrepreneurial spirit as much as formal experience. Academic credentials are not a requirement if you can demonstrate your skills and added value. You will be working in a creative, less-structured environment, with a degree of autonomy to implement solutions. You will be able to think about problems in a high-level way using pragmatically common sense. You are comfortable asking for help when you need it. You are capable of accepting direction should a particular solution fit with the longer-term strategic goals of the firm.

What work will the successful candidate do in the first 3-6 months
Work on existing frameworks for the discretionary and quantitative valuation of inflation
bottom up and top down models of inflation
leading indicators
fixing analysis
Develop new tools to identify developments in inflation markets
Monitor macroeconomic developments, identify trends
Specific macro focus will be on UK inflation including modelling of RPI indices
Recommend trade ideas in inflation markets to Portfolio Management team
Implement quantitative frameworks within the technology infrastructure of the firm; work on visualisation tools to ensure that the output of the created models is distributed within the firm
Requirements
Practical knowledge of inflation markets, key drivers, valuation frameworks
Experience with the UK market (RPI) is a plus. Candidates who lack this experience are still encouraged to apply as we provide specific market training
Excellent problem solving and diagnostic skills
Understanding of financial economics, knowledge of statistics / econometrics
Curiosity and confidence in supporting new technologies, software, programming languages
Knowledge of at least of one programming language (Julia, Python, Matlab, D, other)
Ability to work under pressure and able to prioritize work
Highly detail oriented, self-directed, entrepreneurial and keen to learn
Exceptional verbal and written communication skills
Ability to present complex research outcomes with clarity and brevity

You will need to show us examples of any publicly-shareable code that you’ve written (hobby projects, open source contributions). A link to your GitHub would help expedite the selection process.
What to Expect from our Interview Process
Our interview process is not a cookie cutter process and changes based on the candidate. In general, you should expect:

- An introductory meeting and an aptitude assessment. The aptitude assessment is not a pass/fail test, and we do the same aptitude assessment for all candidates coming to Symmetry - so it cannot be a test of competency for a certain role. We're trying to understand what you're good at and what you're bad at, to try to form a role around your strengths and weaknesses.

A meeting with a member of the team for an open discussion on your background, experiences and how you may fit into the team.

A meeting with someone technical. We're not looking for everyone to be a software developer, but we do like having technical people meet candidates to see how they approach complex problems, how they can break them down and solve them, and how they learn.

Iteration from there, based on the feedback from the interviews and any further interviews to try to figure out where you'd best fit within Symmetry and what role we can create for you.

Grant Thornton UK LLP is part of a global network of independent audit, tax and advisory firms, made up of some 58,000 people in over 135 countries. We're a team of independent thinkers who put quality, inclusion and integrity first. All around the world we bring a different experience to our clients. A better experience. One that delivers the expertise they need in a way that goes beyond. Personal, proactive, and agile. That's Grant Thornton.
Job Description:
NEW GROUND WON’T BREAK ITSELF.
Every day our teams help people in businesses and communities to do what is right and achieve their goals.
Grant Thornton is making major investment in the formation of Grant Thornton Economic Consulting - providing specialist economic advice across all our legal, corporate and public sector clients. Frequently working alongside colleagues from across Grant Thornton, we advise on high profile issues in all major sectors of the economy.
Our Economic Consulting team works across three markets:
The legal market providing expert economic analysis to High Courts, International Arbitration Hearings and Competition Courts across a wide range of cases and settings
The public sector market providing advice to Governments, regulatory agencies and related agencies on policy and financing issues
The private sector market on a wide range of regulatory strategic and transactional issues.
In each of these markets our work requires strong econometric analysis. Given the growth of projects requiring these skills we are now looking to recruit a further Manager or Senior Manager to bolster our existing team. The scope of work you may be involved is exceptionally broad and could include estimation of complex counterfactuals, market demand forecasting, profitability analysis, estimation of default probabilities, valuation of companies, and estimation of damages alongside many other applications of econometrics.
Whilst our Economic Consulting practice is a separate operating unit that goes to market as a specialist provider, it also works closely with our market leading Financial Services Group (FSG), Public Sector Advisory (PAS) and Forensic and Investigations Services (FIS) practices. Given the nature of work in a multi-disciplinary firm, joint delivery and marketing with Directors and Partners from across the FSG, PAS and FIS practices will be a key part of this role.
We’re happy to talk flexible working and consider reduced hours and job shares, we’ll support you to balance your work and life.
A look into the role
As an Econometrician within our Economic Consulting team, you will be:
Responsible for the delivery and quality assurance of econometric work across the wide range of projects conducted across the team
Work closely with a small team of other similarly skilled team members focused on quantitative issues
Working alongside other Directors and Partners from Economic Consulting and other parts of the firm to co tribute to proposals and build relationships across the firms client base
Support the development of the economic consulting practice and its team members, potentially undertaking training and people management roles to support the development of less experienced team members.
Knowing you’re right for us
Joining us as an Econometrician, the minimum criteria is experience of using econometrics across a wide range of issues. However, your experience may have been more focused on a specific use of econometrics previously and want to expand that scope. It would be great if you had some of the following skills, but don't worry if you don't tick every box, we'll help you develop along the way.
Educated to a post graduate level as an economist, holding a PhD or an MSC with a substantial econometric component.
Whilst heavily in nature you must have the ability to explain your work to an informed but non specialist audience.
Substantial experience obtained from working within one or more of an economics consultancy, commercial firms, Government or regulatory authority.
Knowing we’re right for you
Embracing uniqueness, the culture at Grant Thornton thrives on the contributions of all our people, we never settle for what is easy, we look beyond to deliver the right thing, for everyone. Building an inclusive culture, where we value difference and respect our colleagues helps our people to perform at the best of their ability and realise their potential.

Life is more than work. The things you do, and the people you’re with outside of work matter, that’s why we’re happy to look at flexible working options for all our roles, and we’ll always do our best to keep your work and life in balance.
The impact you can make here will go far beyond your day job.

2.8",Econometrician,"London, England",£156K - £161K (Employer Est.),-1,501 to 1000 Employees,-1,Company - Public,Advertising & Public Relations,Media & Communication,Unknown / Non-Applicable,2.5,2.2,2.6,2.3,2.1,"HELLO…We're looking for a Econometrician

Who are we?
We're Mediahub. A growing global media agency built specifically for challenger brands looking to challenge the status quo.
It is our secret sauce – media creativity – that truly differentiates us. In a world with more ad blockers and ad-free environments, ever greater media fragmentation and growing attention scarcity, not all impressions are equal. We believe this makes creativity the most powerful economic multiplier any media agency can leverage and is a critical ingredient for challenger brands seeking an unfair share of attention.
Although part of the MullenLowe Group, we are powered by IPG's Mediabrands and have access to all the resources, intelligence, and buying power associated with the largest media companies, but remain small enough to provide clients with our best people and move with great alacrity.

What will you do?
As our Econometrician, you will be responsible for the end to end modelling process from technical specification, development, delivery and maintenance and updates of models for our clients.
It's a fantastic opportunity to build a modern econometric proposition within an agency which believes in the challenger mindset whilst building on existing award winning work!
You will also be responsible for methodology and model selection and will work closely with our data engineer with regards to the agency's data infrastructure systems built on the AWS stack which we use to warehouse data suitable for modelling. You will also be the go to data technologist for our clients providing recommendations and roadmapping econometric solutions to answer questions and offer pivotal insight.

About you
This specialist senior role will suit candidates with a strong interest in unleashing the power of econometrics in the team and a demonstrable background in econometrics. The role offers those who are familiar with econometrics an opportunity to build our econometrics product, incorporating the latest thinking and to be pivotal in building super cool applications using ML such as our award winning NBD tool on our website as an example.
At Mediahub we believe that people are what make great places to work. We believe in meritocracy, and that hard work and star quality should get rewarded. You will need to be ready to hit the ground running, and looking to now do the best work of your career. If so, we'd look forward to meeting you.

Benefits
Extra holiday days you can buy, your birthday off, gym discounts, a running club, healthcare, discounted massages and just about everything else you can think of! Dedicated to our people, we provide extensive benefits to help with that work life balance. We focus on great people, great work, effectiveness, creativity and passion. If that sounds like the place for you then we want to meet you!
Mediahub is an equal opportunity employer. We celebrate diversity and are committed to creating an inclusive environment for all employees.

Symmetry Investments is a global investment company with offices in Hong Kong, Singapore, London, Jersey and Cayman Islands. We have been in business since 2014 after successfully spinning off from a major New York-based hedge fund.

At Symmetry Investments, we seek to engage in intelligent risk-taking to create value for our clients, partners and employees. We derive our edge from our capacity to generate Win-Wins – in the broadest sense. Win-Win is our fundamental ethical and strategic principle. By generating Win-Wins, we can create unique solutions that reconcile perspectives that are usually seen as incompatible or opposites, and encompass the best that each side has to offer:
We integrate fixed-income arbitrage with global macro strategies in a novel way.
We invent and develop technology that focuses on the potential of human-machine integration.
We build systems where machines do what they do best, supporting people to do what people do best.
We are creating a collaborative meritocracy: a culture where individual contribution serves both personal and collective goals - and is rewarded accordingly.
We value both ownership thinking AND cooperative team spirit, self-realization AND community.

Job Description

We are seeking a candidate for a Quantitative Macro Researcher position focusing on inflation markets of developed countries. The position is within the Quantitative Macro Research team responsible for developing tools to analyse macro economic developments as well as identify opportunities in fixed income and FX markets.

Your role will include developing discretionary frameworks and quantitative models. You will also conduct thematic and ad-hoc research when necessary. You will use these frameworks to recommend practical investment opportunities. Specific focus will be on the UK market, initially. In addition, you will implement your models within our technology systems as well as visualise research output. You will create processes and tests to ensure robust implementation of the models, data used and processes to run these models. You should be hands on to be able to work with data, implement models and deliver results. You will be consulting with other researchers and interacting with developers on performing the analysis, prototyping a solution and automating research workflow.

We value interest and capabilities, entrepreneurial spirit as much as formal experience. Academic credentials are not a requirement if you can demonstrate your skills and added value. You will be working in a creative, less-structured environment, with a degree of autonomy to implement solutions. You will be able to think about problems in a high-level way using pragmatically common sense. You are comfortable asking for help when you need it. You are capable of accepting direction should a particular solution fit with the longer-term strategic goals of the firm.

What work will the successful candidate do in the first 3-6 months
Work on existing frameworks for the discretionary and quantitative valuation of inflation
bottom up and top down models of inflation
leading indicators
fixing analysis
Develop new tools to identify developments in inflation markets
Monitor macroeconomic developments, identify trends
Specific macro focus will be on UK inflation including modelling of RPI indices
Recommend trade ideas in inflation markets to Portfolio Management team
Implement quantitative frameworks within the technology infrastructure of the firm; work on visualisation tools to ensure that the output of the created models is distributed within the firm
Requirements
Practical knowledge of inflation markets, key drivers, valuation frameworks
Experience with the UK market (RPI) is a plus. Candidates who lack this experience are still encouraged to apply as we provide specific market training
Excellent problem solving and diagnostic skills
Understanding of financial economics, knowledge of statistics / econometrics
Curiosity and confidence in supporting new technologies, software, programming languages
Knowledge of at least of one programming language (Julia, Python, Matlab, D, other)
Ability to work under pressure and able to prioritize work
Highly detail oriented, self-directed, entrepreneurial and keen to learn
Exceptional verbal and written communication skills
Ability to present complex research outcomes with clarity and brevity

You will need to show us examples of any publicly-shareable code that you’ve written (hobby projects, open source contributions). A link to your GitHub would help expedite the selection process.
What to Expect from our Interview Process
Our interview process is not a cookie cutter process and changes based on the candidate. In general, you should expect:

- An introductory meeting and an aptitude assessment. The aptitude assessment is not a pass/fail test, and we do the same aptitude assessment for all candidates coming to Symmetry - so it cannot be a test of competency for a certain role. We're trying to understand what you're good at and what you're bad at, to try to form a role around your strengths and weaknesses.

A meeting with a member of the team for an open discussion on your background, experiences and how you may fit into the team.

A meeting with someone technical. We're not looking for everyone to be a software developer, but we do like having technical people meet candidates to see how they approach complex problems, how they can break them down and solve them, and how they learn.

Iteration from there, based on the feedback from the interviews and any further interviews to try to figure out where you'd best fit within Symmetry and what role we can create for you.

In addition we provide 28 days annual leave with the option to purchase an additional 10.

Frontier is entirely owned by its employees. As Shareholders, we encourage everyone to put forward their views.

More than you expected
Grant Thornton UK LLP is part of a global network of independent audit, tax and advisory firms, made up of some 58,000 people in over 135 countries. We're a team of independent thinkers who put quality, inclusion and integrity first. All around the world we bring a different experience to our clients. A better experience. One that delivers the expertise they need in a way that goes beyond. Personal, proactive, and agile. That's Grant Thornton.
Job Description:
NEW GROUND WON’T BREAK ITSELF.
Every day our teams help people in businesses and communities to do what is right and achieve their goals.
Grant Thornton is making major investment in the formation of Grant Thornton Economic Consulting - providing specialist economic advice across all our legal, corporate and public sector clients. Frequently working alongside colleagues from across Grant Thornton, we advise on high profile issues in all major sectors of the economy.
Our Economic Consulting team works across three markets:
The legal market providing expert economic analysis to High Courts, International Arbitration Hearings and Competition Courts across a wide range of cases and settings
The public sector market providing advice to Governments, regulatory agencies and related agencies on policy and financing issues
The private sector market on a wide range of regulatory strategic and transactional issues.
In each of these markets our work requires strong econometric analysis. Given the growth of projects requiring these skills we are now looking to recruit a further Manager or Senior Manager to bolster our existing team. The scope of work you may be involved is exceptionally broad and could include estimation of complex counterfactuals, market demand forecasting, profitability analysis, estimation of default probabilities, valuation of companies, and estimation of damages alongside many other applications of econometrics.
Whilst our Economic Consulting practice is a separate operating unit that goes to market as a specialist provider, it also works closely with our market leading Financial Services Group (FSG), Public Sector Advisory (PAS) and Forensic and Investigations Services (FIS) practices. Given the nature of work in a multi-disciplinary firm, joint delivery and marketing with Directors and Partners from across the FSG, PAS and FIS practices will be a key part of this role.
We’re happy to talk flexible working and consider reduced hours and job shares, we’ll support you to balance your work and life.
A look into the role
As an Econometrician within our Economic Consulting team, you will be:
Responsible for the delivery and quality assurance of econometric work across the wide range of projects conducted across the team
Work closely with a small team of other similarly skilled team members focused on quantitative issues
Working alongside other Directors and Partners from Economic Consulting and other parts of the firm to co tribute to proposals and build relationships across the firms client base
Support the development of the economic consulting practice and its team members, potentially undertaking training and people management roles to support the development of less experienced team members.
Knowing you’re right for us
Joining us as an Econometrician, the minimum criteria is experience of using econometrics across a wide range of issues. However, your experience may have been more focused on a specific use of econometrics previously and want to expand that scope. It would be great if you had some of the following skills, but don't worry if you don't tick every box, we'll help you develop along the way.
Educated to a post graduate level as an economist, holding a PhD or an MSC with a substantial econometric component.
Whilst heavily in nature you must have the ability to explain your work to an informed but non specialist audience.
Substantial experience obtained from working within one or more of an economics consultancy, commercial firms, Government or regulatory authority.
Knowing we’re right for you
Embracing uniqueness, the culture at Grant Thornton thrives on the contributions of all our people, we never settle for what is easy, we look beyond to deliver the right thing, for everyone. Building an inclusive culture, where we value difference and respect our colleagues helps our people to perform at the best of their ability and realise their potential.
Our open and accessible culture means you’ll interact with leaders who are interested in you and everything you bring to our firm. The things that set you apart, we value them. That’s why we give you the freedom to bring your whole self to work and pursue your passions inside and outside of work.
Beyond the job
Life is more than work. The things you do, and the people you’re with outside of work matter, that’s why we’re happy to look at flexible working options for all our roles, and we’ll always do our best to keep your work and life in balance.
The impact you can make here will go far beyond your day job. From secondments, to fundraising for local charities, or investing in entrepreneurs in the developing world, you’ll be giving back to society. It’s that drive to do the right thing that runs through our every move, grounded in our CLEARR values – Collaboration, Leadership, Excellence, Agility, Respect and Responsibility.
We’re looking for people who want to contribute, spark fresh ideas and go beyond expectations. People who want to be able to proudly do what’s right, for the firm, our clients, our people and themselves. It’s how it should be.

Who are we?
We're Mediahub. A growing global media agency built specifically for challenger brands looking to challenge the status quo.
It is our secret sauce – media creativity – that truly differentiates us. In a world with more ad blockers and ad-free environments, ever greater media fragmentation and growing attention scarcity, not all impressions are equal. We believe this makes creativity the most powerful economic multiplier any media agency can leverage and is a critical ingredient for challenger brands seeking an unfair share of attention.
Although part of the MullenLowe Group, we are powered by IPG's Mediabrands and have access to all the resources, intelligence, and buying power associated with the largest media companies, but remain small enough to provide clients with our best people and move with great alacrity.

What will you do?
As our Econometrician, you will be responsible for the end to end modelling process from technical specification, development, delivery and maintenance and updates of models for our clients.
It's a fantastic opportunity to build a modern econometric proposition within an agency which believes in the challenger mindset whilst building on existing award winning work!
You will also be responsible for methodology and model selection and will work closely with our data engineer with regards to the agency's data infrastructure systems built on the AWS stack which we use to warehouse data suitable for modelling. You will also be the go to data technologist for our clients providing recommendations and roadmapping econometric solutions to answer questions and offer pivotal insight.

About you
This specialist senior role will suit candidates with a strong interest in unleashing the power of econometrics in the team and a demonstrable background in econometrics. The role offers those who are familiar with econometrics an opportunity to build our econometrics product, incorporating the latest thinking and to be pivotal in building super cool applications using ML such as our award winning NBD tool on our website as an example.
At Mediahub we believe that people are what make great places to work. We believe in meritocracy, and that hard work and star quality should get rewarded. You will need to be ready to hit the ground running, and looking to now do the best work of your career. If so, we'd look forward to meeting you.

Benefits
Extra holiday days you can buy, your birthday off, gym discounts, a running club, healthcare, discounted massages and just about everything else you can think of! Dedicated to our people, we provide extensive benefits to help with that work life balance. We focus on great people, great work, effectiveness, creativity and passion. If that sounds like the place for you then we want to meet you!
