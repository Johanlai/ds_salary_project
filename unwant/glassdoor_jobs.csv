We work together to safeguard Britain’s people, interests and businesses from various threats at home, overseas and online. To do that, we rely on data. On our Intelligence Data Analyst Development Programmes in either agency you’ll see you don’t need to be a data expert to help protect the UK - just yourself. Our operations are hugely varied, which is why increasing the diversity of our people is needed more than ever before.
To protect the UK, we need people with different perspectives and backgrounds. There’s no one ‘type’ of person we recruit. You don’t need to have coding or programming skills, but you’ll have some experience analysing data and will be keen to develop your abilities further with our support and training. You’ll have (or be expecting) a 2:2 degree in any subject or have relevant work experience.
Relying on data, our Intelligence Analyst’s play a crucial role in keeping the country safe. It can be complex, but understanding it is key to the success of our operations.

We have opportunities available in either MI5 or MI6.
The programme at MI5 is based in London and begins with a 3-month training period, where you’ll learn more about the organisation and our processes. Then, you’ll do 3 different analyst postings right in the heart of MI5. Over the course of 5 years and beyond, you’ll develop your technical skills, work with tools that can’t be found anywhere else, and gain experience to support a fulfilling and rewarding career in analysis.
If you choose the programme at MI6, you’ll work for MI6 but be based in Cheltenham for the first two years before moving to London. You’ll join a multi-organisational analysis team, playing a vital role in turning raw data into intelligence to help keep our country safe. Your first six months on the programme will include a mixture of formal training in technical and analytical tools as well as on the job learning.
For more information, please visit the Intelligence and Data Analyst Development Programme on our website.
The application window for the Intelligence and Data Analyst Programme will open on 6th February 2023.

We are confining registrations of interest to those from an Ethnic Minority background only, due to their current under-representation in our workforce.

HM Revenue and Customs has made significant progress with its plans to locate in 14 large, modern, flexible offices, equipped with high-speed digital infrastructure supporting improved customer service and compliance activity. These collaborative workspaces will enable smarter working and great training and development facilities, allowing for the sharing of expertise, local training, promotion, and provide great ongoing career development opportunities.

We're on a mission to drive the global renewable energy revolution, and we need loads more people to help us make our vision a reality.

Octopus buys power directly from wind, solar and hydro sites all over the UK (and soon all over the world). This allows us to supply our customers with green electricity, straight from the source.
We’re looking for an Analyst to support us as we sign contracts to buy power from more and bigger renewable generators. This Analyst will lead on pricing, risk management and performance monitoring. This will all be done with a view to paying a fair price to renewable generators, and delivering green electricity to Octopus customers at the lowest possible cost.

The ideal candidate will have a passion for using data to enable the transition to renewable energy. And will be comfortable with all the moving parts and complexity that come with the energy industry.

Instead of working in large, siloed teams, our trading, risk, forecasting and data science functions work closely together. We use technology to maintain a lean operation as the company grows. We focus on the big problems and give people the autonomy and resources to find innovative solutions.
What you'll do
Create processes to track performance from contracting through to delivery, identifying areas for improvement.
Quantify and categorise risks in Octopus’s renewable energy origination processes.
Improve and maintain pricing tools, taking risks and historical performance into account.
Develop custom pricing proposals that are mutually beneficial to Octopus and renewable generators.
Work with the Forecasting Team to help Improve and maintain models for forecasting wind, solar and hydro generation at the level of the individual site.
Support the development of innovative commercial structures between Octopus's supply business and Octopus Energy GenerationDevelop alerting for generator outages or reduced performance.
Work with other teams at Octopus, including Strategy, Finance, Generation, Business, Hydrogen and many more.
Support Octopus businesses in other countries by sharing experience and best practices.
What you'll need
Passion for renewables and the energy transition.
Desire to explore complex systems and an ability to learn fast.
Ability to communicate complicated concepts in a way that everyone can understand.
Commercial awareness and financial literacy to identify and understand the problems that need solving.
Comprehensive knowledge of data design, data modelling, data management and data visualisation.
Experience with a scripting language (ideally Python).Experience writing complex queries in SQL, analysing large datasets and building reports and dashboards.
Why else you'll love it here
Wondering what the salary for this role is? Just ask us! On a call with one of our recruiters it's something we always cover as we genuinely want to match your experience with the correct salary. The reason why we don't advertise is because we honestly have a degree of flexibility and would never want salary to be a reason why someone doesn't apply to Octopus - what's more important to us is finding the right octofit!
Octopus Energy is a unique culture. An organisation where people learn, decide, and build quicker. Where people work with autonomy, alongside a wide range of amazing co-owners, on projects that break new ground. We want your hard work to be rewarded with perks you actually care about! We won best company to work for in 2022, on Glassdoor we were voted 50 best places to work in 2022 and our Group CEO, Greg has recorded a podcast about our culture and how we empower our people.

Ensuring that all agreed reports are produced from the Data Warehouse in a timely manner and sent to the relevant recipients on a working-daily basis, investigating any queries raised by the recipients of the reports, and liaising with the rest of the Business Intelligence Team where appropriate to find solutions
Engaging in peer reviews to validate data and test others work before deployment
Being passionate about solving problems with complete and well-organised data, providing ‘the best version of the truth’ to Portman stakeholders as information for decision-making

You will help to unlock the value of Sainsbury’s enormous multi-brand, multi-channel data asset in a centralised ‘mini consultancy’ style analytics team that supports wide parts of the business. And you will use your intense curiosity to find creative ways to land impactful analysis that directly supports the Sainsbury’s strategy of ‘Win in Food,’ ‘Brands that Deliver,’ and ‘Save to Invest.’
A bit about the role
You will be an Analytics Lead and part of a high calibre team of Analysts, supported by Analytics Managers in exploiting Sainsbury’s data assets to establish the realisation of Sainsbury’s strategy. As a lead in this team, you will manage one direct report and together carve out a backlog of work to deliver.
Your primary focus will be on delivering analytical value for our Commercial divisions, and will work across the core brands of Sainsbury’s, Argos, Tu and Habitat.
You will have a great analytical foundation, and we want you to think about how you apply that in the context of Sainsbury’s – getting to know how we operate is key so you can propose and recommend the approach that should be taken to fulfil data analysis.
You will develop & maintain relationships with your stakeholders, championing a collaborative approach to requirements gathering and the formation of compelling analysis. While staying confident in questioning a proposed strategy or approach to analysis.
We move at pace, whilst still delivering high quality, accurate, professional outputs that land the real truths that sit within the data. You will proactively ensure you are always in touch with the ‘Why’ behind every project – understanding the purpose of your analysis, and which decisions the business is looking to inform.
You will take pride in your work, have brilliant attention to detail, and enjoy presenting findings with empathy towards an audience with a limited technical background. Possessing the ability to translate complex concepts into easily digestible stories with data, which in turn inspire action.
You will embrace our values of Owning It, Making it Better and Being Human.
What you need to know and show
A highly numerate background. You may have a degree in mathematics, statistics or another analytical subject, or analytical work experience.
Excellent SQL knowledge is essential. Python, R or EMR experience is helpful but not vital.
Experience using tools to extract data such as SQL (Snowflake), Python, R and Amazon EMR.
A proven history of delivering actionable insight and demonstrable business change through the application of analytics.
An inquisitive mind, with the curiosity to be constantly on the lookout for opportunities and the ability to logically solve problems. Experience of retail and the analytical challenges retail presents is helpful, but not essential.
A passion for high quality data storytelling. We love data and deriving value from it. The key to the value is in being able to build and tell compelling stories based on this data.
Keen to learn and develop. Pro-active about driving your career development and progression.
The ability to partner brilliantly with the business to understand their problems and deliver value, applying commercial acumen and communicating/connecting in a compelling way.
A high level of team contribution – looking for opportunities to provide input and support across the wider analytics community.
In return you will get:
Colleague discount across the multi-brands – Sainsbury’s, Argos, and Habitat
Holiday allowance
Bonus scheme
Pension plan
Private medical insurance
Special offers on gym memberships, restaurants, holidays, retail vouchers and more
Flexible working
Work-life balance is important to us, so we offer our colleagues as much flexibility as possible in line with the needs of their role. We trust them to decide how, where and when they work, combining remote and collaborative working with a flexible approach to hours, giving them plenty of time and space for life outside of work whilst delivering against our business goals.

We work together to safeguard Britain’s people, interests and businesses from various threats at home, overseas and online. To do that, we rely on data. On our Intelligence Data Analyst Development Programmes in either agency you’ll see you don’t need to be a data expert to help protect the UK - just yourself. Our operations are hugely varied, which is why increasing the diversity of our people is needed more than ever before.
To protect the UK, we need people with different perspectives and backgrounds. There’s no one ‘type’ of person we recruit. You don’t need to have coding or programming skills, but you’ll have some experience analysing data and will be keen to develop your abilities further with our support and training. You’ll have (or be expecting) a 2:2 degree in any subject or have relevant work experience.
Relying on data, our Intelligence Analyst’s play a crucial role in keeping the country safe. It can be complex, but understanding it is key to the success of our operations. And if you think you know what sort of person works in data, think again. On our Intelligence and Data Analyst Development Programmes, you’ll see you don’t need to be a data expert to help protect the UK - just yourself.
We have opportunities available in either MI5 or MI6.
The programme at MI5 is based in London and begins with a 3-month training period, where you’ll learn more about the organisation and our processes. Then, you’ll do 3 different analyst postings right in the heart of MI5. Over the course of 5 years and beyond, you’ll develop your technical skills, work with tools that can’t be found anywhere else, and gain experience to support a fulfilling and rewarding career in analysis.
If you choose the programme at MI6, you’ll work for MI6 but be based in Cheltenham for the first two years before moving to London. You’ll join a multi-organisational analysis team, playing a vital role in turning raw data into intelligence to help keep our country safe. Your first six months on the programme will include a mixture of formal training in technical and analytical tools as well as on the job learning.
For more information, please visit the Intelligence and Data Analyst Development Programme on our website.
The application window for the Intelligence and Data Analyst Programme will open on 6th February 2023. In the meantime, we are looking for individuals who are from an Ethnic Minority background*, to register their interest in this forthcoming opportunity. As part of the registration of interest, you will be invited to an online event prior to the campaign opening.
Please note that a registration of interest does not constitute a job application, nor will such registration have any bearing upon the recruitment process itself. Any individuals who register their interest and who decide subsequently to apply to the Intelligence and Data Analyst Development Programmes, will need to complete an application form once the window for applications has opened.

We are confining registrations of interest to those from an Ethnic Minority background only, due to their current under-representation in our workforce. Once the application window has opened, we will welcome applications from all candidates, regardless of their ethnic background, gender, disability and/or any other characteristic(s). All applications will be assessed solely on merit.

We work together to safeguard Britain’s people, interests and businesses from various threats at home, overseas and online. To do that, we rely on data. On our Intelligence Data Analyst Development Programmes in either agency you’ll see you don’t need to be a data expert to help protect the UK - just yourself. Our operations are hugely varied, which is why increasing the diversity of our people is needed more than ever before.
To protect the UK, we need people with different perspectives and backgrounds. There’s no one ‘type’ of person we recruit. You don’t need to have coding or programming skills, but you’ll have some experience analysing data and will be keen to develop your abilities further with our support and training. You’ll have (or be expecting) a 2:2 degree in any subject or have relevant work experience.
Relying on data, our Intelligence Analyst’s play a crucial role in keeping the country safe. It can be complex, but understanding it is key to the success of our operations. And if you think you know what sort of person works in data, think again. On our Intelligence and Data Analyst Development Programmes, you’ll see you don’t need to be a data expert to help protect the UK - just yourself.
We have opportunities available in either MI5 or MI6.
The programme at MI5 is based in London and begins with a 3-month training period, where you’ll learn more about the organisation and our processes. Then, you’ll do 3 different analyst postings right in the heart of MI5. Over the course of 5 years and beyond, you’ll develop your technical skills, work with tools that can’t be found anywhere else, and gain experience to support a fulfilling and rewarding career in analysis.
If you choose the programme at MI6, you’ll work for MI6 but be based in Cheltenham for the first two years before moving to London. You’ll join a multi-organisational analysis team, playing a vital role in turning raw data into intelligence to help keep our country safe. Your first six months on the programme will include a mixture of formal training in technical and analytical tools as well as on the job learning.
For more information, please visit the Intelligence and Data Analyst Development Programme on our website.
The application window for the Intelligence and Data Analyst Programme will open on 6th February 2023. In the meantime, we are looking for individuals who are from an Ethnic Minority background*, to register their interest in this forthcoming opportunity. As part of the registration of interest, you will be invited to an online event prior to the campaign opening.
Please note that a registration of interest does not constitute a job application, nor will such registration have any bearing upon the recruitment process itself. Any individuals who register their interest and who decide subsequently to apply to the Intelligence and Data Analyst Development Programmes, will need to complete an application form once the window for applications has opened.

We are confining registrations of interest to those from an Ethnic Minority background only, due to their current under-representation in our workforce.

If you choose the programme at MI6, you’ll work for MI6 but be based in Cheltenham for the first two years before moving to London. You’ll join a multi-organisational analysis team, playing a vital role in turning raw data into intelligence to help keep our country safe. Your first six months on the programme will include a mixture of formal training in technical and analytical tools as well as on the job learning.

This is a time of significant change as the way we collect and manage data, and compile statistics, evolves in the light of the use of new technology with DAT at the forefront. The change draws on a wide range of skill sets, including: data management; data science; operational work; subject matter expertise in aspects of economics, statistics and banking and insurance supervision; and people and process management.

FSG has made good progress building skills in data science applications, such as R and Tableau, in order to build new tools to better carry out the work of the group.

We work together to safeguard Britain’s people, interests and businesses from various threats at home, overseas and online. To do that, we rely on data. On our Intelligence Data Analyst Development Programmes in either agency you’ll see you don’t need to be a data expert to help protect the UK - just yourself. Our operations are hugely varied, which is why increasing the diversity of our people is needed more than ever before.
To protect the UK, we need people with different perspectives and backgrounds. There’s no one ‘type’ of person we recruit. You don’t need to have coding or programming skills, but you’ll have some experience analysing data and will be keen to develop your abilities further with our support and training. You’ll have (or be expecting) a 2:2 degree in any subject or have relevant work experience.
Relying on data, our Intelligence Analyst’s play a crucial role in keeping the country safe. It can be complex, but understanding it is key to the success of our operations. And if you think you know what sort of person works in data, think again. On our Intelligence and Data Analyst Development Programmes, you’ll see you don’t need to be a data expert to help protect the UK - just yourself.
We have opportunities available in either MI5 or MI6.
The programme at MI5 is based in London and begins with a 3-month training period, where you’ll learn more about the organisation and our processes. Then, you’ll do 3 different analyst postings right in the heart of MI5. Over the course of 5 years and beyond, you’ll develop your technical skills, work with tools that can’t be found anywhere else, and gain experience to support a fulfilling and rewarding career in analysis.
If you choose the programme at MI6, you’ll work for MI6 but be based in Cheltenham for the first two years before moving to London. You’ll join a multi-organisational analysis team, playing a vital role in turning raw data into intelligence to help keep our country safe. Your first six months on the programme will include a mixture of formal training in technical and analytical tools as well as on the job learning.
For more information, please visit the Intelligence and Data Analyst Development Programme on our website.
The application window for the Intelligence and Data Analyst Programme will open on 6th February 2023. In the meantime, we are looking for individuals who are from an Ethnic Minority background*, to register their interest in this forthcoming opportunity. As part of the registration of interest, you will be invited to an online event prior to the campaign opening.
Please note that a registration of interest does not constitute a job application, nor will such registration have any bearing upon the recruitment process itself. Any individuals who register their interest and who decide subsequently to apply to the Intelligence and Data Analyst Development Programmes, will need to complete an application form once the window for applications has opened.

We are confining registrations of interest to those from an Ethnic Minority background only, due to their current under-representation in our workforce. Once the application window has opened, we will welcome applications from all candidates, regardless of their ethnic background, gender, disability and/or any other characteristic(s). All applications will be assessed solely on merit.

The Data and Statistics Division (DSD), part of the Data and Analytics Transformation (DAT) Directorate, is the division with responsibilities that span production and management of some of the Bank’s core datasets. The directorate more broadly is responsible for aspects of data management and data culture that reach into the working lives of almost all Bank staff. This is a time of significant change as the way we collect and manage data, and compile statistics, evolves in the light of the use of new technology with DAT at the forefront. The change draws on a wide range of skill sets, including: data management; data science; operational work; subject matter expertise in aspects of economics, statistics and banking and insurance supervision; and people and process management. The roles are in the Financial Statistics Group (FSG) whose focus is on the analysis, compilation, and publication of key statistical outputs such as monetary financial institutions’ contribution to the National Accounts, International Banking Statistics, and capital issuance.
Data compiled by FSG are used by the ONS and a variety of international organisations, including the Eurostat, BIS, IMF, and more, and feature in headline UK statistics such as the Gross Domestic Product, Balance of Payments, and UK Trade. FSG has made good progress building skills in data science applications, such as R and Tableau, in order to build new tools to better carry out the work of the group. This experience will contribute to wider divisional and directorate work, including the large project that DSD is undertaking to replace and upgrade its in-house database.

Successful candidates will have an inquisitive mind able to understand developments in the economy affect data submitted by firms, identify inconsistencies and teasing out market intelligence that will be of interest across the Bank.
