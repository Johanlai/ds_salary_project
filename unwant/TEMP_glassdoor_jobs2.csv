We work together to safeguard Britain’s people, interests and businesses from various threats at home, overseas and online. To do that, we rely on data. On our Intelligence Data Analyst Development Programmes in either agency you’ll see you don’t need to be a data expert to help protect the UK - just yourself. Our operations are hugely varied, which is why increasing the diversity of our people is needed more than ever before.
To protect the UK, we need people with different perspectives and backgrounds. There’s no one ‘type’ of person we recruit. You don’t need to have coding or programming skills, but you’ll have some experience analysing data and will be keen to develop your abilities further with our support and training. You’ll have (or be expecting) a 2:2 degree in any subject or have relevant work experience.
Relying on data, our Intelligence Analyst’s play a crucial role in keeping the country safe. It can be complex, but understanding it is key to the success of our operations.

We have opportunities available in either MI5 or MI6.
The programme at MI5 is based in London and begins with a 3-month training period, where you’ll learn more about the organisation and our processes. Then, you’ll do 3 different analyst postings right in the heart of MI5. Over the course of 5 years and beyond, you’ll develop your technical skills, work with tools that can’t be found anywhere else, and gain experience to support a fulfilling and rewarding career in analysis.
If you choose the programme at MI6, you’ll work for MI6 but be based in Cheltenham for the first two years before moving to London. You’ll join a multi-organisational analysis team, playing a vital role in turning raw data into intelligence to help keep our country safe. Your first six months on the programme will include a mixture of formal training in technical and analytical tools as well as on the job learning.
For more information, please visit the Intelligence and Data Analyst Development Programme on our website.
The application window for the Intelligence and Data Analyst Programme will open on 6th February 2023.

As part of the registration of interest, you will be invited to an online event prior to the campaign opening.

Any individuals who register their interest and who decide subsequently to apply to the Intelligence and Data Analyst Development Programmes, will need to complete an application form once the window for applications has opened.

We are confining registrations of interest to those from an Ethnic Minority background only, due to their current under-representation in our workforce.

Successful candidates must pass a Disclosure and Barring Security Check. Please note that HMRC have an exemption under the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act 1974, which enables us to make enquiries about both unspent and spent convictions.
In order to process applications without delay, we will be sending a Criminal Record Check to Disclosure and Barring Service on your behalf.

Applicants who are successful at interview will be, as part of pre-employment screening, subject to a check on the Internal Fraud Database (IFD).

Any applicant’s details held on the IFD will be refused employment.
A candidate is not eligible to apply for a role within the Civil Service if the application is made within a 5 year period following a dismissal for carrying out internal fraud against government.
HMRC transformation
HM Revenue and Customs is currently going through an exciting ten-year transformation programme to create a tax authority fit for the future. As part of this, we are committed to providing high-quality jobs and giving employees a great place to work, whichever location you work from.
HM Revenue and Customs has made significant progress with its plans to locate in 14 large, modern, flexible offices, equipped with high-speed digital infrastructure supporting improved customer service and compliance activity. These collaborative workspaces will enable smarter working and great training and development facilities, allowing for the sharing of expertise, local training, promotion, and provide great ongoing career development opportunities.
These offices will be located in central locations in the following towns and cities close to accessible transport links: Glasgow, Edinburgh, Belfast, Newcastle, Leeds, Liverpool, Manchester, Nottingham, Birmingham, Bristol, Cardiff, Croydon, Portsmouth and Stratford.
In addition, there will also be a small number of specialist sites where the work cannot be done anywhere else, in Gartcosh (near Glasgow), Telford, Ipswich, Worthing and Dover, as well as our headquarters in central London. What’s more, our Welsh language service has people located in Porthmadog, as well as Cardiff.
We are letting you know about our future plans because if you are recruited into an office that is not one of these locations, you will be expected, subject to HM Revenue and Customs applicable policies, to move to one of these locations in the future. In some cases, this will be via one of our nine transitional sites.
For more information please contact the vacancy holder.
Terms and Conditions
We really hope you decide to apply for this role. If you’re successful you need to know that in February 2021 members of recognised trade unions (ARC and PCS) voted to approve a pay and contract reform offer. This means that HMRC will adopt new terms and conditions for all colleagues as part of a multi-year pay deal and contract offer, the pay deal period is 01 June 2020 – 31st May 2023 and terms and conditions changes take place from the 01 June 2021 onwards. These terms will apply to colleagues who already work in HMRC and if you join us, it will apply to you too. We’ve put together a summary of the key changes that will be made and you can find this attached to the Job Advert.

Any move to HMRC from another employer will mean you can no longer access childcare vouchers. This includes moves between government departments. You may however be eligible for other government schemes, including Tax Free Childcare. Determine your eligibility here.
HMRC welcomes applications from those who need to work a more flexible arrangement and will agree to requests where possible, taking into account our operational and customer service needs. We can’t guarantee that we can meet all requests to work flexibly, as agreement will be subject to business ability to accommodate, and any request to work a more flexible arrangement should be made prior to your acceptance of the provisional offer.

Hello! Are you a data analyst who loves to work with data to uncover amazing insights on consumer behaviour? We should talk!
Element Human is a tech company that has built incredible new insight tools for the media industry, to help the world's biggest media platforms, agencies and brands understand their audiences more than ever before.

Across TV, online and social, Element Human has developed a multi-method approach to audience analysis that employs facial coding, eye-tracking, implicit association, and brand metrics. Our global client base includes media platforms that are household names, top performing media agencies, and globally successful brands. Our clients test their content - whether TVC's, branded content, social posts, pre-rolls or other - using our all in one dashboard, and use the insight to fine tune campaigns, generate creative ideas, and produce end of campaign reports.
Element Human is an example of the incredible contribution that machine learning and AI can bring to traditional research methods. Our solution makes time-consuming and costly methodologies easy: setup is simple, fieldwork runs automatically, results are processed and delivered straight to our dashboard or via our API, and the whole process is extremely cost efficient.

Our testing platform measures how people respond to content, and what that means for their attitudes and behaviour. Having this data allows us to unearth incredible insights to share with the media industry:

What emotion delivers best engagement in the US for sustainability brands?
Which social platform holds attention longer amongst older audiences?
Should an ad start with a strong emotion hook, or end with one?

The answers to these questions and more lie in our data - you just need to reveal it. Giddy with excitement? Can't wait to dive in? Then this is the job for you.

Collaborating with the Product and Customer Success teams to ensure projects are set up correctly and carried out on time and to spec.

IT and Business Change

innocent started with a simple mission: to make drinks that make it easy to do yourself some good. In 1999 we concocted a few smoothies in our kitchen and tested them on people at a music festival; today we’re blending every type of fruit & veg under the sun and selling drinks right across Europe. We have great ambitions: to show the world that you can build a successful business that cares about more than just profit, and to leave things better than we find them. We’re proud to call ourselves Europe’s favourite little healthy drinks company, but we’re still growing. And that means we need more brilliant people who share our ambition, to join in with the next, most exciting, part of our story.

innocent have undergone a large programme of work to transform the systems and processes that sit at the heart of our business and support the running of a brand new factory (the blender). Alongside this we’ve also created the brand new Data & Analytics team to leverage the power of the data these systems provide.

We are now looking for an accomplished Project Manager, reporting into the Data & Analytics lead, to support our project delivery and hit our long term roadmap. Success will mean our data, and the insights it can provide, becomes embedded into innocent’s culture, ultimately making it easy for our people to work smart.

From the initial ideas right through planning, building, testing, go-live, business handover and project closure, you’ll be making sure we hit our milestones, manage our risks and issues, navigate around unplanned changes and keep our stakeholders informed. And deliver great results that make everyone’s working lives that bit easier.

you'll have
Project Management experience
Experience or an interest of working on data / analytics projects
Understanding of and confidence using standard project methodology, process, and frameworks
Pride in your attention to detail, organisation, and proactivity
Strong stakeholder management and influencing ability across all levels of the business
Comfort with conflict, bringing people together to resolve issues and hold them to account
It would be ideal if you'd have:
Knowledge of Power BI and Microsoft D365

you'll get
An opportunity to join a brand new team (Data & Analytics) where you can have a real impact from the start, making the most of your skills and delivering real value across all areas of the business.

We’re relatively early in our data and analytics journey but this position will play a key role in developing our capabilities into new and exciting areas.

What’s more, you will be a part of the wider project management community with plenty of opportunities to learn and develop your career.

You will help us to keep doing business the right way – keeping innocent one of the Sunday Times Best Places to Work, using our B Corp status to inspire wider change, and reinforcing our culture of staying little as we grow big. At innocent, it’s the relationships and friendships we create while working together, that make us who we are. It’s why we love hybrid working – a mix of connecting in person and remotely. We’re also aware that the world is changing, and we all want and need different things from our work and home lives. So, if you need to walk the dog, go to the gym, or have commitments outside of work, we’re open to talking through flexible working options that work for you and us.
In return for everything you can bring, we can offer you an exciting, challenging role in a fast-growing and dynamic business, with plenty of career opportunities in the UK and across Europe as well as a competitive rewards package.

We work together to safeguard Britain’s people, interests and businesses from various threats at home, overseas and online. To do that, we rely on data. On our Intelligence Data Analyst Development Programmes in either agency you’ll see you don’t need to be a data expert to help protect the UK - just yourself. Our operations are hugely varied, which is why increasing the diversity of our people is needed more than ever before.
To protect the UK, we need people with different perspectives and backgrounds. There’s no one ‘type’ of person we recruit. You don’t need to have coding or programming skills, but you’ll have some experience analysing data and will be keen to develop your abilities further with our support and training. You’ll have (or be expecting) a 2:2 degree in any subject or have relevant work experience.
Relying on data, our Intelligence Analyst’s play a crucial role in keeping the country safe. It can be complex, but understanding it is key to the success of our operations. And if you think you know what sort of person works in data, think again. On our Intelligence and Data Analyst Development Programmes, you’ll see you don’t need to be a data expert to help protect the UK - just yourself.
We have opportunities available in either MI5 or MI6.
The programme at MI5 is based in London and begins with a 3-month training period, where you’ll learn more about the organisation and our processes. Then, you’ll do 3 different analyst postings right in the heart of MI5. Over the course of 5 years and beyond, you’ll develop your technical skills, work with tools that can’t be found anywhere else, and gain experience to support a fulfilling and rewarding career in analysis.
If you choose the programme at MI6, you’ll work for MI6 but be based in Cheltenham for the first two years before moving to London. You’ll join a multi-organisational analysis team, playing a vital role in turning raw data into intelligence to help keep our country safe. Your first six months on the programme will include a mixture of formal training in technical and analytical tools as well as on the job learning.
For more information, please visit the Intelligence and Data Analyst Development Programme on our website.
The application window for the Intelligence and Data Analyst Programme will open on 6th February 2023. In the meantime, we are looking for individuals who are from an Ethnic Minority background*, to register their interest in this forthcoming opportunity. As part of the registration of interest, you will be invited to an online event prior to the campaign opening.
Please note that a registration of interest does not constitute a job application, nor will such registration have any bearing upon the recruitment process itself. Any individuals who register their interest and who decide subsequently to apply to the Intelligence and Data Analyst Development Programmes, will need to complete an application form once the window for applications has opened.

We are confining registrations of interest to those from an Ethnic Minority background only, due to their current under-representation in our workforce. Once the application window has opened, we will welcome applications from all candidates, regardless of their ethnic background, gender, disability and/or any other characteristic(s). All applications will be assessed solely on merit.

Relying on data, our Intelligence Analyst’s play a crucial role in keeping the country safe. It can be complex, but understanding it is key to the success of our operations.

We have opportunities available in either MI5 or MI6.
The programme at MI5 is based in London and begins with a 3-month training period, where you’ll learn more about the organisation and our processes.

Over the course of 5 years and beyond, you’ll develop your technical skills, work with tools that can’t be found anywhere else, and gain experience to support a fulfilling and rewarding career in analysis.

HM Revenue and Customs has made significant progress with its plans to locate in 14 large, modern, flexible offices, equipped with high-speed digital infrastructure supporting improved customer service and compliance activity.

You don’t need to have coding or programming skills, but you’ll have some experience analysing data and will be keen to develop your abilities further with our support and training. You’ll have (or be expecting) a 2:2 degree in any subject or have relevant work experience.
Relying on data, our Intelligence Analyst’s play a crucial role in keeping the country safe. It can be complex, but understanding it is key to the success of our operations. And if you think you know what sort of person works in data, think again. On our Intelligence and Data Analyst Development Programmes, you’ll see you don’t need to be a data expert to help protect the UK - just yourself.
We have opportunities available in either MI5 or MI6.
The programme at MI5 is based in London and begins with a 3-month training period, where you’ll learn more about the organisation and our processes. Then, you’ll do 3 different analyst postings right in the heart of MI5. Over the course of 5 years and beyond, you’ll develop your technical skills, work with tools that can’t be found anywhere else, and gain experience to support a fulfilling and rewarding career in analysis.
If you choose the programme at MI6, you’ll work for MI6 but be based in Cheltenham for the first two years before moving to London. You’ll join a multi-organisational analysis team, playing a vital role in turning raw data into intelligence to help keep our country safe. Your first six months on the programme will include a mixture of formal training in technical and analytical tools as well as on the job learning.
For more information, please visit the Intelligence and Data Analyst Development Programme on our website.
The application window for the Intelligence and Data Analyst Programme will open on 6th February 2023. In the meantime, we are looking for individuals who are from an Ethnic Minority background*, to register their interest in this forthcoming opportunity. As part of the registration of interest, you will be invited to an online event prior to the campaign opening.
Please note that a registration of interest does not constitute a job application, nor will such registration have any bearing upon the recruitment process itself. Any individuals who register their interest and who decide subsequently to apply to the Intelligence and Data Analyst Development Programmes, will need to complete an application form once the window for applications has opened.

We are confining registrations of interest to those from an Ethnic Minority background only, due to their current under-representation in our workforce. Once the application window has opened, we will welcome applications from all candidates, regardless of their ethnic background, gender, disability and/or any other characteristic(s). All applications will be assessed solely on merit.

The Data and Statistics Division (DSD), part of the Data and Analytics Transformation (DAT) Directorate, is the division with responsibilities that span production and management of some of the Bank’s core datasets. The directorate more broadly is responsible for aspects of data management and data culture that reach into the working lives of almost all Bank staff. This is a time of significant change as the way we collect and manage data, and compile statistics, evolves in the light of the use of new technology with DAT at the forefront. The change draws on a wide range of skill sets, including: data management; data science; operational work; subject matter expertise in aspects of economics, statistics and banking and insurance supervision; and people and process management. The roles are in the Financial Statistics Group (FSG) whose focus is on the analysis, compilation, and publication of key statistical outputs such as monetary financial institutions’ contribution to the National Accounts, International Banking Statistics, and capital issuance.
Data compiled by FSG are used by the ONS and a variety of international organisations, including the Eurostat, BIS, IMF, and more, and feature in headline UK statistics such as the Gross Domestic Product, Balance of Payments, and UK Trade. FSG has made good progress building skills in data science applications, such as R and Tableau, in order to build new tools to better carry out the work of the group.

We work together to safeguard Britain’s people, interests and businesses from various threats at home, overseas and online. To do that, we rely on data. On our Intelligence Data Analyst Development Programmes in either agency you’ll see you don’t need to be a data expert to help protect the UK - just yourself. Our operations are hugely varied, which is why increasing the diversity of our people is needed more than ever before.
To protect the UK, we need people with different perspectives and backgrounds. There’s no one ‘type’ of person we recruit. You don’t need to have coding or programming skills, but you’ll have some experience analysing data and will be keen to develop your abilities further with our support and training.

Relying on data, our Intelligence Analyst’s play a crucial role in keeping the country safe. It can be complex, but understanding it is key to the success of our operations.

Over the course of 5 years and beyond, you’ll develop your technical skills, work with tools that can’t be found anywhere else, and gain experience to support a fulfilling and rewarding career in analysis.
If you choose the programme at MI6, you’ll work for MI6 but be based in Cheltenham for the first two years before moving to London. You’ll join a multi-organisational analysis team, playing a vital role in turning raw data into intelligence to help keep our country safe. Your first six months on the programme will include a mixture of formal training in technical and analytical tools as well as on the job learning.

Job Posting 13-Jan-2023, 10:33:46 AM

Directorate Overview
The Bank of England is the UK's central bank. Our mission is to deliver monetary and financial stability for the British people.
The Bank of England is a diverse organisation. Each of its 4,000 people are committed to public service and dedicated to promoting the good of the people of the United Kingdom by maintaining monetary and financial stability.
The Data and Statistics Division (DSD), part of the Data and Analytics Transformation (DAT) Directorate, is the division with responsibilities that span production and management of some of the Bank’s core datasets. The directorate more broadly is responsible for aspects of data management and data culture that reach into the working lives of almost all Bank staff. This is a time of significant change as the way we collect and manage data, and compile statistics, evolves in the light of the use of new technology with DAT at the forefront. The change draws on a wide range of skill sets, including: data management; data science; operational work; subject matter expertise in aspects of economics, statistics and banking and insurance supervision; and people and process management. The roles are in the Financial Statistics Group (FSG) whose focus is on the analysis, compilation, and publication of key statistical outputs such as monetary financial institutions’ contribution to the National Accounts, International Banking Statistics, and capital issuance.
Data compiled by FSG are used by the ONS and a variety of international organisations, including the Eurostat, BIS, IMF, and more, and feature in headline UK statistics such as the Gross Domestic Product, Balance of Payments, and UK Trade. FSG has made good progress building skills in data science applications, such as R and Tableau, in order to build new tools to better carry out the work of the group. This experience will contribute to wider divisional and directorate work, including the large project that DSD is undertaking to replace and upgrade its in-house database.
Job description
FSG is seeking proactive and highly motivated individuals to provide analytical input to the processes used to compile, analyse and publish the group’s high profile statistical datasets. Successful candidates will also find opportunities to learn and develop skills in analytical tools such as R (as well as other coding packages/tools) should that interest them. These have been used to deliver tangible benefits for the groups’ production work to date, and further examples are always being sought. Roles in FSG provide a good opportunity for candidates who are interested in working in a live, high profile operational area of the Bank.

The directorate more broadly is responsible for aspects of data management and data culture that reach into the working lives of almost all Bank staff. This is a time of significant change as the way we collect and manage data, and compile statistics, evolves in the light of the use of new technology with DAT at the forefront.

FSG has made good progress building skills in data science applications, such as R and Tableau, in order to build new tools to better carry out the work of the group.

Our operations are hugely varied, which is why increasing the diversity of our people is needed more than ever before.
To protect the UK, we need people with different perspectives and backgrounds. There’s no one ‘type’ of person we recruit. You don’t need to have coding or programming skills, but you’ll have some experience analysing data and will be keen to develop your abilities further with our support and training. You’ll have (or be expecting) a 2:2 degree in any subject or have relevant work experience.
Relying on data, our Intelligence Analyst’s play a crucial role in keeping the country safe. It can be complex, but understanding it is key to the success of our operations. And if you think you know what sort of person works in data, think again. On our Intelligence and Data Analyst Development Programmes, you’ll see you don’t need to be a data expert to help protect the UK - just yourself.
We have opportunities available in either MI5 or MI6.
The programme at MI5 is based in London and begins with a 3-month training period, where you’ll learn more about the organisation and our processes. Then, you’ll do 3 different analyst postings right in the heart of MI5. Over the course of 5 years and beyond, you’ll develop your technical skills, work with tools that can’t be found anywhere else, and gain experience to support a fulfilling and rewarding career in analysis.
If you choose the programme at MI6, you’ll work for MI6 but be based in Cheltenham for the first two years before moving to London. You’ll join a multi-organisational analysis team, playing a vital role in turning raw data into intelligence to help keep our country safe. Your first six months on the programme will include a mixture of formal training in technical and analytical tools as well as on the job learning.
For more information, please visit the Intelligence and Data Analyst Development Programme on our website.
The application window for the Intelligence and Data Analyst Programme will open on 6th February 2023. In the meantime, we are looking for individuals who are from an Ethnic Minority background*, to register their interest in this forthcoming opportunity. As part of the registration of interest, you will be invited to an online event prior to the campaign opening.
Please note that a registration of interest does not constitute a job application, nor will such registration have any bearing upon the recruitment process itself. Any individuals who register their interest and who decide subsequently to apply to the Intelligence and Data Analyst Development Programmes, will need to complete an application form once the window for applications has opened.

We are confining registrations of interest to those from an Ethnic Minority background only, due to their current under-representation in our workforce. Once the application window has opened, we will welcome applications from all candidates, regardless of their ethnic background, gender, disability and/or any other characteristic(s). All applications will be assessed solely on merit.

FSG has made good progress building skills in data science applications, such as R and Tableau, in order to build new tools to better carry out the work of the group.

If you choose the programme at MI6, you’ll work for MI6 but be based in Cheltenham for the first two years before moving to London. You’ll join a multi-organisational analysis team, playing a vital role in turning raw data into intelligence to help keep our country safe.

Directorate Overview
The Bank of England is the UK's central bank. Our mission is to deliver monetary and financial stability for the British people.
The Bank of England is a diverse organisation. Each of its 4,000 people are committed to public service and dedicated to promoting the good of the people of the United Kingdom by maintaining monetary and financial stability.
The Data and Statistics Division (DSD), part of the Data and Analytics Transformation (DAT) Directorate, is the division with responsibilities that span production and management of some of the Bank’s core datasets. The directorate more broadly is responsible for aspects of data management and data culture that reach into the working lives of almost all Bank staff. This is a time of significant change as the way we collect and manage data, and compile statistics, evolves in the light of the use of new technology with DAT at the forefront. The change draws on a wide range of skill sets, including: data management; data science; operational work; subject matter expertise in aspects of economics, statistics and banking and insurance supervision; and people and process management. The roles are in the Financial Statistics Group (FSG) whose focus is on the analysis, compilation, and publication of key statistical outputs such as monetary financial institutions’ contribution to the National Accounts, International Banking Statistics, and capital issuance.
Data compiled by FSG are used by the ONS and a variety of international organisations, including the Eurostat, BIS, IMF, and more, and feature in headline UK statistics such as the Gross Domestic Product, Balance of Payments, and UK Trade. FSG has made good progress building skills in data science applications, such as R and Tableau, in order to build new tools to better carry out the work of the group. This experience will contribute to wider divisional and directorate work, including the large project that DSD is undertaking to replace and upgrade its in-house database.

Roles in FSG provide a good opportunity for candidates who are interested in working in a live, high profile operational area of the Bank.

You’ll join a multi-organisational analysis team, playing a vital role in turning raw data into intelligence to help keep our country safe.

The Bank of England is a diverse organisation. Each of its 4,000 people are committed to public service and dedicated to promoting the good of the people of the United Kingdom by maintaining monetary and financial stability.
The Data and Statistics Division (DSD), part of the Data and Analytics Transformation (DAT) Directorate, is the division with responsibilities that span production and management of some of the Bank’s core datasets. The directorate more broadly is responsible for aspects of data management and data culture that reach into the working lives of almost all Bank staff. This is a time of significant change as the way we collect and manage data, and compile statistics, evolves in the light of the use of new technology with DAT at the forefront. The change draws on a wide range of skill sets, including: data management; data science; operational work; subject matter expertise in aspects of economics, statistics and banking and insurance supervision; and people and process management. The roles are in the Financial Statistics Group (FSG) whose focus is on the analysis, compilation, and publication of key statistical outputs such as monetary financial institutions’ contribution to the National Accounts, International Banking Statistics, and capital issuance.
Data compiled by FSG are used by the ONS and a variety of international organisations, including the Eurostat, BIS, IMF, and more, and feature in headline UK statistics such as the Gross Domestic Product, Balance of Payments, and UK Trade. FSG has made good progress building skills in data science applications, such as R and Tableau, in order to build new tools to better carry out the work of the group. This experience will contribute to wider divisional and directorate work, including the large project that DSD is undertaking to replace and upgrade its in-house database.

Successful candidates will also find opportunities to learn and develop skills in analytical tools such as R (as well as other coding packages/tools) should that interest them. These have been used to deliver tangible benefits for the groups’ production work to date, and further examples are always being sought. Roles in FSG provide a good opportunity for candidates who are interested in working in a live, high profile operational area of the Bank.
The role will involve working to strict deadlines, quality assuring, compiling, and analysing data that feed in to a variety of statistics produced by FSG. Successful candidates will have an inquisitive mind able to understand developments in the economy affect data submitted by firms, identify inconsistencies and teasing out market intelligence that will be of interest across the Bank.

One way we support diversity and inclusion is through our staff-run networks, which are summarised here.
We are fully committed to having a diverse and inclusive working environment, and are open to considering how the role might be carried out with flexible working. This role is therefore open to flexible working patterns.

From 6 June 2022, we expect colleagues to spend a minimum of 40% of their working time in the office per month. Subject to that minimum requirement, individuals and managers should work together to find what works best for them and their team.

We work together to safeguard Britain’s people, interests and businesses from various threats at home, overseas and online. To do that, we rely on data. On our Intelligence Data Analyst Development Programmes in either agency you’ll see you don’t need to be a data expert to help protect the UK - just yourself. Our operations are hugely varied, which is why increasing the diversity of our people is needed more than ever before.
To protect the UK, we need people with different perspectives and backgrounds. There’s no one ‘type’ of person we recruit. You don’t need to have coding or programming skills, but you’ll have some experience analysing data and will be keen to develop your abilities further with our support and training. You’ll have (or be expecting) a 2:2 degree in any subject or have relevant work experience.
Relying on data, our Intelligence Analyst’s play a crucial role in keeping the country safe. It can be complex, but understanding it is key to the success of our operations. And if you think you know what sort of person works in data, think again. On our Intelligence and Data Analyst Development Programmes, you’ll see you don’t need to be a data expert to help protect the UK - just yourself.
We have opportunities available in either MI5 or MI6.
The programme at MI5 is based in London and begins with a 3-month training period, where you’ll learn more about the organisation and our processes. Then, you’ll do 3 different analyst postings right in the heart of MI5. Over the course of 5 years and beyond, you’ll develop your technical skills, work with tools that can’t be found anywhere else, and gain experience to support a fulfilling and rewarding career in analysis.
If you choose the programme at MI6, you’ll work for MI6 but be based in Cheltenham for the first two years before moving to London. You’ll join a multi-organisational analysis team, playing a vital role in turning raw data into intelligence to help keep our country safe. Your first six months on the programme will include a mixture of formal training in technical and analytical tools as well as on the job learning.
For more information, please visit the Intelligence and Data Analyst Development Programme on our website.

Job Posting 13-Jan-2023, 10:33:46 AM

Directorate Overview
The Bank of England is the UK's central bank. Our mission is to deliver monetary and financial stability for the British people.
The Bank of England is a diverse organisation. Each of its 4,000 people are committed to public service and dedicated to promoting the good of the people of the United Kingdom by maintaining monetary and financial stability.
The Data and Statistics Division (DSD), part of the Data and Analytics Transformation (DAT) Directorate, is the division with responsibilities that span production and management of some of the Bank’s core datasets. The directorate more broadly is responsible for aspects of data management and data culture that reach into the working lives of almost all Bank staff. This is a time of significant change as the way we collect and manage data, and compile statistics, evolves in the light of the use of new technology with DAT at the forefront. The change draws on a wide range of skill sets, including: data management; data science; operational work; subject matter expertise in aspects of economics, statistics and banking and insurance supervision; and people and process management. The roles are in the Financial Statistics Group (FSG) whose focus is on the analysis, compilation, and publication of key statistical outputs such as monetary financial institutions’ contribution to the National Accounts, International Banking Statistics, and capital issuance.
Data compiled by FSG are used by the ONS and a variety of international organisations, including the Eurostat, BIS, IMF, and more, and feature in headline UK statistics such as the Gross Domestic Product, Balance of Payments, and UK Trade. FSG has made good progress building skills in data science applications, such as R and Tableau, in order to build new tools to better carry out the work of the group. This experience will contribute to wider divisional and directorate work, including the large project that DSD is undertaking to replace and upgrade its in-house database.
Job description
FSG is seeking proactive and highly motivated individuals to provide analytical input to the processes used to compile, analyse and publish the group’s high profile statistical datasets. Successful candidates will also find opportunities to learn and develop skills in analytical tools such as R (as well as other coding packages/tools) should that interest them. These have been used to deliver tangible benefits for the groups’ production work to date, and further examples are always being sought. Roles in FSG provide a good opportunity for candidates who are interested in working in a live, high profile operational area of the Bank.
The role will involve working to strict deadlines, quality assuring, compiling, and analysing data that feed in to a variety of statistics produced by FSG. Successful candidates will have an inquisitive mind able to understand developments in the economy affect data submitted by firms, identify inconsistencies and teasing out market intelligence that will be of interest across the Bank. The role will also involve project work, which can range from developing and improving processes or creating new analytical tools, to reviewing data methodology or conceptual pieces of analysis.

You’ll join a multi-organisational analysis team, playing a vital role in turning raw data into intelligence to help keep our country safe.

About Royal London

Royal London is the largest mutual life insurance, pensions and investment company in the UK. Since its foundation 160 years ago, Royal London has supported millions of people to protect and provide for themselves and their families.

Royal London Asset Management (RLAM) was established in 1988 and is a wholly owned and central part of the Royal London Group. Since our inception we have built a reputation as an innovative, high performing fund manager. Our track record and exceptional client service have been recognised with a number of awards. We are proud of the people we employ, the performance we have delivered and the wide-ranging group of clients we manage.

At Royal London, our People Promise is that we will all work somewhere inclusive, responsible, enjoyable and fulfilling. This promise has been at the heart of our approach to hybrid working, ensuing a balance of time working in our offices, supporting the culture of collaboration and inclusion and some working time from home, so we can all continue to benefit from the flexibility this brings. Our hybrid working approach is built around our mutual mindset, thinking about what is good for us as individuals (the ‘me’) and in the context of what is right for our customers, our colleagues and The Royal London group (the ‘we’). Together we belong- collaborate – learn and perform.

Our expectation is that colleagues working in hybrid roles will come into the office for 50% of their time, and the rest from home. We want to be as consistent as we can with our approach but we also appreciate some colleagues need adjustments based on personal circumstances. (e.g. to support a disability, or caring responsibility) and / or may wish to formally seek a flexible working pattern in line with our flexible working policy.

We appreciate the world of work continues to evolve and we will continue to listen to our colleagues views on this whilst ensuring our on-going approach is right for our business and customers
We are an equal opportunities employer. We work hard to attract the best talent for our award-winning team. We believe that embracing difference makes us stronger. Our diverse people bring us different skills – whatever their educational background, disability, gender, age, sexual orientation, race, religion or belief.

We work together to safeguard Britain’s people, interests and businesses from various threats at home, overseas and online. To do that, we rely on data. On our Intelligence Data Analyst Development Programmes in either agency you’ll see you don’t need to be a data expert to help protect the UK - just yourself. Our operations are hugely varied, which is why increasing the diversity of our people is needed more than ever before.
To protect the UK, we need people with different perspectives and backgrounds. There’s no one ‘type’ of person we recruit. You don’t need to have coding or programming skills, but you’ll have some experience analysing data and will be keen to develop your abilities further with our support and training. You’ll have (or be expecting) a 2:2 degree in any subject or have relevant work experience.
Relying on data, our Intelligence Analyst’s play a crucial role in keeping the country safe. It can be complex, but understanding it is key to the success of our operations. And if you think you know what sort of person works in data, think again. On our Intelligence and Data Analyst Development Programmes, you’ll see you don’t need to be a data expert to help protect the UK - just yourself.
We have opportunities available in either MI5 or MI6.
The programme at MI5 is based in London and begins with a 3-month training period, where you’ll learn more about the organisation and our processes. Then, you’ll do 3 different analyst postings right in the heart of MI5. Over the course of 5 years and beyond, you’ll develop your technical skills, work with tools that can’t be found anywhere else, and gain experience to support a fulfilling and rewarding career in analysis.
If you choose the programme at MI6, you’ll work for MI6 but be based in Cheltenham for the first two years before moving to London. You’ll join a multi-organisational analysis team, playing a vital role in turning raw data into intelligence to help keep our country safe. Your first six months on the programme will include a mixture of formal training in technical and analytical tools as well as on the job learning.
For more information, please visit the Intelligence and Data Analyst Development Programme on our website.
The application window for the Intelligence and Data Analyst Programme will open on 6th February 2023. In the meantime, we are looking for individuals who are from an Ethnic Minority background*, to register their interest in this forthcoming opportunity. As part of the registration of interest, you will be invited to an online event prior to the campaign opening.
Please note that a registration of interest does not constitute a job application, nor will such registration have any bearing upon the recruitment process itself. Any individuals who register their interest and who decide subsequently to apply to the Intelligence and Data Analyst Development Programmes, will need to complete an application form once the window for applications has opened.

We are confining registrations of interest to those from an Ethnic Minority background only, due to their current under-representation in our workforce.

We work together to safeguard Britain’s people, interests and businesses from various threats at home, overseas and online. To do that, we rely on data. On our Intelligence Data Analyst Development Programmes in either agency you’ll see you don’t need to be a data expert to help protect the UK - just yourself. Our operations are hugely varied, which is why increasing the diversity of our people is needed more than ever before.
To protect the UK, we need people with different perspectives and backgrounds. There’s no one ‘type’ of person we recruit. You don’t need to have coding or programming skills, but you’ll have some experience analysing data and will be keen to develop your abilities further with our support and training. You’ll have (or be expecting) a 2:2 degree in any subject or have relevant work experience.
Relying on data, our Intelligence Analyst’s play a crucial role in keeping the country safe. It can be complex, but understanding it is key to the success of our operations. And if you think you know what sort of person works in data, think again. On our Intelligence and Data Analyst Development Programmes, you’ll see you don’t need to be a data expert to help protect the UK - just yourself.
We have opportunities available in either MI5 or MI6.
The programme at MI5 is based in London and begins with a 3-month training period, where you’ll learn more about the organisation and our processes. Then, you’ll do 3 different analyst postings right in the heart of MI5. Over the course of 5 years and beyond, you’ll develop your technical skills, work with tools that can’t be found anywhere else, and gain experience to support a fulfilling and rewarding career in analysis.
If you choose the programme at MI6, you’ll work for MI6 but be based in Cheltenham for the first two years before moving to London. You’ll join a multi-organisational analysis team, playing a vital role in turning raw data into intelligence to help keep our country safe. Your first six months on the programme will include a mixture of formal training in technical and analytical tools as well as on the job learning.
For more information, please visit the Intelligence and Data Analyst Development Programme on our website.
The application window for the Intelligence and Data Analyst Programme will open on 6th February 2023. In the meantime, we are looking for individuals who are from an Ethnic Minority background*, to register their interest in this forthcoming opportunity. As part of the registration of interest, you will be invited to an online event prior to the campaign opening.
Please note that a registration of interest does not constitute a job application, nor will such registration have any bearing upon the recruitment process itself. Any individuals who register their interest and who decide subsequently to apply to the Intelligence and Data Analyst Development Programmes, will need to complete an application form once the window for applications has opened.

We are confining registrations of interest to those from an Ethnic Minority background only, due to their current under-representation in our workforce. Once the application window has opened, we will welcome applications from all candidates, regardless of their ethnic background, gender, disability and/or any other characteristic(s).

Directorate Overview
The Bank of England is the UK's central bank. Our mission is to deliver monetary and financial stability for the British people.
The Bank of England is a diverse organisation. Each of its 4,000 people are committed to public service and dedicated to promoting the good of the people of the United Kingdom by maintaining monetary and financial stability.
The Data and Statistics Division (DSD), part of the Data and Analytics Transformation (DAT) Directorate, is the division with responsibilities that span production and management of some of the Bank’s core datasets. The directorate more broadly is responsible for aspects of data management and data culture that reach into the working lives of almost all Bank staff. This is a time of significant change as the way we collect and manage data, and compile statistics, evolves in the light of the use of new technology with DAT at the forefront. The change draws on a wide range of skill sets, including: data management; data science; operational work; subject matter expertise in aspects of economics, statistics and banking and insurance supervision; and people and process management. The roles are in the Financial Statistics Group (FSG) whose focus is on the analysis, compilation, and publication of key statistical outputs such as monetary financial institutions’ contribution to the National Accounts, International Banking Statistics, and capital issuance.
Data compiled by FSG are used by the ONS and a variety of international organisations, including the Eurostat, BIS, IMF, and more, and feature in headline UK statistics such as the Gross Domestic Product, Balance of Payments, and UK Trade. FSG has made good progress building skills in data science applications, such as R and Tableau, in order to build new tools to better carry out the work of the group. This experience will contribute to wider divisional and directorate work, including the large project that DSD is undertaking to replace and upgrade its in-house database.
Job description
FSG is seeking proactive and highly motivated individuals to provide analytical input to the processes used to compile, analyse and publish the group’s high profile statistical datasets. Successful candidates will also find opportunities to learn and develop skills in analytical tools such as R (as well as other coding packages/tools) should that interest them. These have been used to deliver tangible benefits for the groups’ production work to date, and further examples are always being sought. Roles in FSG provide a good opportunity for candidates who are interested in working in a live, high profile operational area of the Bank.
The role will involve working to strict deadlines, quality assuring, compiling, and analysing data that feed in to a variety of statistics produced by FSG. Successful candidates will have an inquisitive mind able to understand developments in the economy affect data submitted by firms, identify inconsistencies and teasing out market intelligence that will be of interest across the Bank. The role will also involve project work, which can range from developing and improving processes or creating new analytical tools, to reviewing data methodology or conceptual pieces of analysis. As the role is part of team, good interpersonal and team working are required, as well the ability to communicate effectively.
Role Requirements
Minimum (Essential) Criteria
Strong analytical and numerical skills are essential for this job; data must be handled and manipulated accurately.

The Bank values diversity and inclusion – we want to reflect the society we serve better, we want the best people to work for us and we want our workplace to be inclusive. We value all forms of diversity, including but not limited to age, disability, ethnicity, gender, gender identity, race, religion and sexual orientation. One way we support diversity and inclusion is through our staff-run networks, which are summarised here.
We are fully committed to having a diverse and inclusive working environment, and are open to considering how the role might be carried out with flexible working. This role is therefore open to flexible working patterns.
Where a role can be carried out from home, we are working towards colleagues spending at least half of their time in the office, so that we can all benefit from working together in person, while maintaining the flexibility offered by home working. From 6 June 2022, we expect colleagues to spend a minimum of 40% of their working time in the office per month.

Developing enriched content within Portman’s analysis dashboards using Microsoft PowerBI to author queries, datasets, visuals and reports
Championing and facilitating the use of the Portman Data Warehouse across the business, leading by example
Ensuring that all agreed reports are produced from the Data Warehouse in a timely manner and sent to the relevant recipients on a working-daily basis, investigating any queries raised by the recipients of the reports, and liaising with the rest of the Business Intelligence Team where appropriate to find solutions
Engaging in peer reviews to validate data and test others work before deployment
Being passionate about solving problems with complete and well-organised data, providing ‘the best version of the truth’ to Portman stakeholders as information for decision-making

We work together to safeguard Britain’s people, interests and businesses from various threats at home, overseas and online. To do that, we rely on data. On our Intelligence Data Analyst Development Programmes in either agency you’ll see you don’t need to be a data expert to help protect the UK - just yourself. Our operations are hugely varied, which is why increasing the diversity of our people is needed more than ever before.
To protect the UK, we need people with different perspectives and backgrounds. There’s no one ‘type’ of person we recruit. You don’t need to have coding or programming skills, but you’ll have some experience analysing data and will be keen to develop your abilities further with our support and training. You’ll have (or be expecting) a 2:2 degree in any subject or have relevant work experience.
Relying on data, our Intelligence Analyst’s play a crucial role in keeping the country safe. It can be complex, but understanding it is key to the success of our operations. And if you think you know what sort of person works in data, think again. On our Intelligence and Data Analyst Development Programmes, you’ll see you don’t need to be a data expert to help protect the UK - just yourself.
We have opportunities available in either MI5 or MI6.
The programme at MI5 is based in London and begins with a 3-month training period, where you’ll learn more about the organisation and our processes. Then, you’ll do 3 different analyst postings right in the heart of MI5. Over the course of 5 years and beyond, you’ll develop your technical skills, work with tools that can’t be found anywhere else, and gain experience to support a fulfilling and rewarding career in analysis.
If you choose the programme at MI6, you’ll work for MI6 but be based in Cheltenham for the first two years before moving to London. You’ll join a multi-organisational analysis team, playing a vital role in turning raw data into intelligence to help keep our country safe. Your first six months on the programme will include a mixture of formal training in technical and analytical tools as well as on the job learning.

The directorate more broadly is responsible for aspects of data management and data culture that reach into the working lives of almost all Bank staff.

The roles are in the Financial Statistics Group (FSG) whose focus is on the analysis, compilation, and publication of key statistical outputs such as monetary financial institutions’ contribution to the National Accounts, International Banking Statistics, and capital issuance.
Data compiled by FSG are used by the ONS and a variety of international organisations, including the Eurostat, BIS, IMF, and more, and feature in headline UK statistics such as the Gross Domestic Product, Balance of Payments, and UK Trade. FSG has made good progress building skills in data science applications, such as R and Tableau, in order to build new tools to better carry out the work of the group.

We work together to safeguard Britain’s people, interests and businesses from various threats at home, overseas and online. To do that, we rely on data. On our Intelligence Data Analyst Development Programmes in either agency you’ll see you don’t need to be a data expert to help protect the UK - just yourself. Our operations are hugely varied, which is why increasing the diversity of our people is needed more than ever before.
To protect the UK, we need people with different perspectives and backgrounds. There’s no one ‘type’ of person we recruit. You don’t need to have coding or programming skills, but you’ll have some experience analysing data and will be keen to develop your abilities further with our support and training. You’ll have (or be expecting) a 2:2 degree in any subject or have relevant work experience.
Relying on data, our Intelligence Analyst’s play a crucial role in keeping the country safe. It can be complex, but understanding it is key to the success of our operations. And if you think you know what sort of person works in data, think again. On our Intelligence and Data Analyst Development Programmes, you’ll see you don’t need to be a data expert to help protect the UK - just yourself.
We have opportunities available in either MI5 or MI6.
The programme at MI5 is based in London and begins with a 3-month training period, where you’ll learn more about the organisation and our processes. Then, you’ll do 3 different analyst postings right in the heart of MI5. Over the course of 5 years and beyond, you’ll develop your technical skills, work with tools that can’t be found anywhere else, and gain experience to support a fulfilling and rewarding career in analysis.
If you choose the programme at MI6, you’ll work for MI6 but be based in Cheltenham for the first two years before moving to London. You’ll join a multi-organisational analysis team, playing a vital role in turning raw data into intelligence to help keep our country safe. Your first six months on the programme will include a mixture of formal training in technical and analytical tools as well as on the job learning.
For more information, please visit the Intelligence and Data Analyst Development Programme on our website.

Any individuals who register their interest and who decide subsequently to apply to the Intelligence and Data Analyst Development Programmes, will need to complete an application form once the window for applications has opened.

We are confining registrations of interest to those from an Ethnic Minority background only, due to their current under-representation in our workforce.

Our operations are hugely varied, which is why increasing the diversity of our people is needed more than ever before.
To protect the UK, we need people with different perspectives and backgrounds. There’s no one ‘type’ of person we recruit. You don’t need to have coding or programming skills, but you’ll have some experience analysing data and will be keen to develop your abilities further with our support and training. You’ll have (or be expecting) a 2:2 degree in any subject or have relevant work experience.
Relying on data, our Intelligence Analyst’s play a crucial role in keeping the country safe. It can be complex, but understanding it is key to the success of our operations.

On our Intelligence and Data Analyst Development Programmes, you’ll see you don’t need to be a data expert to help protect the UK - just yourself.
We have opportunities available in either MI5 or MI6.
The programme at MI5 is based in London and begins with a 3-month training period, where you’ll learn more about the organisation and our processes.

Over the course of 5 years and beyond, you’ll develop your technical skills, work with tools that can’t be found anywhere else, and gain experience to support a fulfilling and rewarding career in analysis.
If you choose the programme at MI6, you’ll work for MI6 but be based in Cheltenham for the first two years before moving to London. You’ll join a multi-organisational analysis team, playing a vital role in turning raw data into intelligence to help keep our country safe. Your first six months on the programme will include a mixture of formal training in technical and analytical tools as well as on the job learning.

We are confining registrations of interest to those from an Ethnic Minority background only, due to their current under-representation in our workforce.

We work together to safeguard Britain’s people, interests and businesses from various threats at home, overseas and online. To do that, we rely on data. On our Intelligence Data Analyst Development Programmes in either agency you’ll see you don’t need to be a data expert to help protect the UK - just yourself. Our operations are hugely varied, which is why increasing the diversity of our people is needed more than ever before.
To protect the UK, we need people with different perspectives and backgrounds. There’s no one ‘type’ of person we recruit. You don’t need to have coding or programming skills, but you’ll have some experience analysing data and will be keen to develop your abilities further with our support and training. You’ll have (or be expecting) a 2:2 degree in any subject or have relevant work experience.
Relying on data, our Intelligence Analyst’s play a crucial role in keeping the country safe. It can be complex, but understanding it is key to the success of our operations. And if you think you know what sort of person works in data, think again. On our Intelligence and Data Analyst Development Programmes, you’ll see you don’t need to be a data expert to help protect the UK - just yourself.
We have opportunities available in either MI5 or MI6.
The programme at MI5 is based in London and begins with a 3-month training period, where you’ll learn more about the organisation and our processes. Then, you’ll do 3 different analyst postings right in the heart of MI5. Over the course of 5 years and beyond, you’ll develop your technical skills, work with tools that can’t be found anywhere else, and gain experience to support a fulfilling and rewarding career in analysis.
If you choose the programme at MI6, you’ll work for MI6 but be based in Cheltenham for the first two years before moving to London. You’ll join a multi-organisational analysis team, playing a vital role in turning raw data into intelligence to help keep our country safe. Your first six months on the programme will include a mixture of formal training in technical and analytical tools as well as on the job learning.
For more information, please visit the Intelligence and Data Analyst Development Programme on our website.
The application window for the Intelligence and Data Analyst Programme will open on 6th February 2023. In the meantime, we are looking for individuals who are from an Ethnic Minority background*, to register their interest in this forthcoming opportunity. As part of the registration of interest, you will be invited to an online event prior to the campaign opening.
Please note that a registration of interest does not constitute a job application, nor will such registration have any bearing upon the recruitment process itself. Any individuals who register their interest and who decide subsequently to apply to the Intelligence and Data Analyst Development Programmes, will need to complete an application form once the window for applications has opened.

We are confining registrations of interest to those from an Ethnic Minority background only, due to their current under-representation in our workforce. Once the application window has opened, we will welcome applications from all candidates, regardless of their ethnic background, gender, disability and/or any other characteristic(s).

Providers include a range of services that generate waste from their operations on RMG premises including waste disposal companies, grounds maintenance, drainage maintenance, confidential waste contractors and catering providers.

Other accountabilities include:

Accountable for the quality and integrity of waste management data by weight, cost, and waste stream type submitted to PFSL and the rest of Royal Mail Group.
Become the subject matter expert on waste data and support RMG in meeting its stated targets for waste reduction.
Build relationships with similar role holders in 3rd party providers to improve the flow of information and develop more useful and usable data.
Carry out site visits and audits to ascertain the effectiveness of PFS Ltd third-party supply chain services and the data they produce with input from operational colleagues and RM customers.
Be flexible in your approach and able to adapt, manage and where necessary drive supplier activity and reporting changes.

Location
Remote working with ad hoc travel to UK sites as and when required.

A Numerate Degree or Relevant Numerate Technical qualifications at or above NVQ level .

The directorate more broadly is responsible for aspects of data management and data culture that reach into the working lives of almost all Bank staff. This is a time of significant change as the way we collect and manage data, and compile statistics, evolves in the light of the use of new technology with DAT at the forefront. The change draws on a wide range of skill sets, including: data management; data science; operational work; subject matter expertise in aspects of economics, statistics and banking and insurance supervision; and people and process management.

Roles in FSG provide a good opportunity for candidates who are interested in working in a live, high profile operational area of the Bank.
The role will involve working to strict deadlines, quality assuring, compiling, and analysing data that feed in to a variety of statistics produced by FSG.

The role will also involve project work, which can range from developing and improving processes or creating new analytical tools, to reviewing data methodology or conceptual pieces of analysis.

We work together to safeguard Britain’s people, interests and businesses from various threats at home, overseas and online. To do that, we rely on data. On our Intelligence Data Analyst Development Programmes in either agency you’ll see you don’t need to be a data expert to help protect the UK - just yourself. Our operations are hugely varied, which is why increasing the diversity of our people is needed more than ever before.
To protect the UK, we need people with different perspectives and backgrounds. There’s no one ‘type’ of person we recruit. You don’t need to have coding or programming skills, but you’ll have some experience analysing data and will be keen to develop your abilities further with our support and training. You’ll have (or be expecting) a 2:2 degree in any subject or have relevant work experience.
Relying on data, our Intelligence Analyst’s play a crucial role in keeping the country safe. It can be complex, but understanding it is key to the success of our operations. And if you think you know what sort of person works in data, think again. On our Intelligence and Data Analyst Development Programmes, you’ll see you don’t need to be a data expert to help protect the UK - just yourself.
We have opportunities available in either MI5 or MI6.
The programme at MI5 is based in London and begins with a 3-month training period, where you’ll learn more about the organisation and our processes. Then, you’ll do 3 different analyst postings right in the heart of MI5. Over the course of 5 years and beyond, you’ll develop your technical skills, work with tools that can’t be found anywhere else, and gain experience to support a fulfilling and rewarding career in analysis.
If you choose the programme at MI6, you’ll work for MI6 but be based in Cheltenham for the first two years before moving to London. You’ll join a multi-organisational analysis team, playing a vital role in turning raw data into intelligence to help keep our country safe. Your first six months on the programme will include a mixture of formal training in technical and analytical tools as well as on the job learning.
For more information, please visit the Intelligence and Data Analyst Development Programme on our website.

HMRC transformation
HM Revenue and Customs is currently going through an exciting ten-year transformation programme to create a tax authority fit for the future. As part of this, we are committed to providing high-quality jobs and giving employees a great place to work, whichever location you work from.
HM Revenue and Customs has made significant progress with its plans to locate in 14 large, modern, flexible offices, equipped with high-speed digital infrastructure supporting improved customer service and compliance activity. These collaborative workspaces will enable smarter working and great training and development facilities, allowing for the sharing of expertise, local training, promotion, and provide great ongoing career development opportunities.

The Bank of England is a diverse organisation. Each of its 4,000 people are committed to public service and dedicated to promoting the good of the people of the United Kingdom by maintaining monetary and financial stability.
The Data and Statistics Division (DSD), part of the Data and Analytics Transformation (DAT) Directorate, is the division with responsibilities that span production and management of some of the Bank’s core datasets. The directorate more broadly is responsible for aspects of data management and data culture that reach into the working lives of almost all Bank staff. This is a time of significant change as the way we collect and manage data, and compile statistics, evolves in the light of the use of new technology with DAT at the forefront.

The roles are in the Financial Statistics Group (FSG) whose focus is on the analysis, compilation, and publication of key statistical outputs such as monetary financial institutions’ contribution to the National Accounts, International Banking Statistics, and capital issuance.
Data compiled by FSG are used by the ONS and a variety of international organisations, including the Eurostat, BIS, IMF, and more, and feature in headline UK statistics such as the Gross Domestic Product, Balance of Payments, and UK Trade. FSG has made good progress building skills in data science applications, such as R and Tableau, in order to build new tools to better carry out the work of the group.

If you choose the programme at MI6, you’ll work for MI6 but be based in Cheltenham for the first two years before moving to London. You’ll join a multi-organisational analysis team, playing a vital role in turning raw data into intelligence to help keep our country safe.

We work together to safeguard Britain’s people, interests and businesses from various threats at home, overseas and online. To do that, we rely on data. On our Intelligence Data Analyst Development Programmes in either agency you’ll see you don’t need to be a data expert to help protect the UK - just yourself. Our operations are hugely varied, which is why increasing the diversity of our people is needed more than ever before.
To protect the UK, we need people with different perspectives and backgrounds. There’s no one ‘type’ of person we recruit. You don’t need to have coding or programming skills, but you’ll have some experience analysing data and will be keen to develop your abilities further with our support and training. You’ll have (or be expecting) a 2:2 degree in any subject or have relevant work experience.
Relying on data, our Intelligence Analyst’s play a crucial role in keeping the country safe. It can be complex, but understanding it is key to the success of our operations. And if you think you know what sort of person works in data, think again. On our Intelligence and Data Analyst Development Programmes, you’ll see you don’t need to be a data expert to help protect the UK - just yourself.
We have opportunities available in either MI5 or MI6.
The programme at MI5 is based in London and begins with a 3-month training period, where you’ll learn more about the organisation and our processes. Then, you’ll do 3 different analyst postings right in the heart of MI5. Over the course of 5 years and beyond, you’ll develop your technical skills, work with tools that can’t be found anywhere else, and gain experience to support a fulfilling and rewarding career in analysis.
If you choose the programme at MI6, you’ll work for MI6 but be based in Cheltenham for the first two years before moving to London. You’ll join a multi-organisational analysis team, playing a vital role in turning raw data into intelligence to help keep our country safe. Your first six months on the programme will include a mixture of formal training in technical and analytical tools as well as on the job learning.
For more information, please visit the Intelligence and Data Analyst Development Programme on our website.
The application window for the Intelligence and Data Analyst Programme will open on 6th February 2023. In the meantime, we are looking for individuals who are from an Ethnic Minority background*, to register their interest in this forthcoming opportunity. As part of the registration of interest, you will be invited to an online event prior to the campaign opening.
Please note that a registration of interest does not constitute a job application, nor will such registration have any bearing upon the recruitment process itself. Any individuals who register their interest and who decide subsequently to apply to the Intelligence and Data Analyst Development Programmes, will need to complete an application form once the window for applications has opened.

We are confining registrations of interest to those from an Ethnic Minority background only, due to their current under-representation in our workforce. Once the application window has opened, we will welcome applications from all candidates, regardless of their ethnic background, gender, disability and/or any other characteristic(s). All applications will be assessed solely on merit.

We work together to safeguard Britain’s people, interests and businesses from various threats at home, overseas and online. To do that, we rely on data. On our Intelligence Data Analyst Development Programmes in either agency you’ll see you don’t need to be a data expert to help protect the UK - just yourself. Our operations are hugely varied, which is why increasing the diversity of our people is needed more than ever before.
To protect the UK, we need people with different perspectives and backgrounds. There’s no one ‘type’ of person we recruit. You don’t need to have coding or programming skills, but you’ll have some experience analysing data and will be keen to develop your abilities further with our support and training. You’ll have (or be expecting) a 2:2 degree in any subject or have relevant work experience.
Relying on data, our Intelligence Analyst’s play a crucial role in keeping the country safe. It can be complex, but understanding it is key to the success of our operations. And if you think you know what sort of person works in data, think again. On our Intelligence and Data Analyst Development Programmes, you’ll see you don’t need to be a data expert to help protect the UK - just yourself.
We have opportunities available in either MI5 or MI6.
The programme at MI5 is based in London and begins with a 3-month training period, where you’ll learn more about the organisation and our processes. Then, you’ll do 3 different analyst postings right in the heart of MI5. Over the course of 5 years and beyond, you’ll develop your technical skills, work with tools that can’t be found anywhere else, and gain experience to support a fulfilling and rewarding career in analysis.
If you choose the programme at MI6, you’ll work for MI6 but be based in Cheltenham for the first two years before moving to London. You’ll join a multi-organisational analysis team, playing a vital role in turning raw data into intelligence to help keep our country safe. Your first six months on the programme will include a mixture of formal training in technical and analytical tools as well as on the job learning.
For more information, please visit the Intelligence and Data Analyst Development Programme on our website.
The application window for the Intelligence and Data Analyst Programme will open on 6th February 2023. In the meantime, we are looking for individuals who are from an Ethnic Minority background*, to register their interest in this forthcoming opportunity. As part of the registration of interest, you will be invited to an online event prior to the campaign opening.
Please note that a registration of interest does not constitute a job application, nor will such registration have any bearing upon the recruitment process itself. Any individuals who register their interest and who decide subsequently to apply to the Intelligence and Data Analyst Development Programmes, will need to complete an application form once the window for applications has opened.

We are confining registrations of interest to those from an Ethnic Minority background only, due to their current under-representation in our workforce. Once the application window has opened, we will welcome applications from all candidates, regardless of their ethnic background, gender, disability and/or any other characteristic(s). All applications will be assessed solely on merit.

Our operations are hugely varied, which is why increasing the diversity of our people is needed more than ever before.
To protect the UK, we need people with different perspectives and backgrounds. There’s no one ‘type’ of person we recruit. You don’t need to have coding or programming skills, but you’ll have some experience analysing data and will be keen to develop your abilities further with our support and training. You’ll have (or be expecting) a 2:2 degree in any subject or have relevant work experience.
Relying on data, our Intelligence Analyst’s play a crucial role in keeping the country safe. It can be complex, but understanding it is key to the success of our operations.

If you choose the programme at MI6, you’ll work for MI6 but be based in Cheltenham for the first two years before moving to London. You’ll join a multi-organisational analysis team, playing a vital role in turning raw data into intelligence to help keep our country safe.

At Royal London, our People Promise is that we will all work somewhere inclusive, responsible, enjoyable and fulfilling.

We work together to safeguard Britain’s people, interests and businesses from various threats at home, overseas and online. To do that, we rely on data. On our Intelligence Data Analyst Development Programmes in either agency you’ll see you don’t need to be a data expert to help protect the UK - just yourself. Our operations are hugely varied, which is why increasing the diversity of our people is needed more than ever before.
To protect the UK, we need people with different perspectives and backgrounds. There’s no one ‘type’ of person we recruit. You don’t need to have coding or programming skills, but you’ll have some experience analysing data and will be keen to develop your abilities further with our support and training. You’ll have (or be expecting) a 2:2 degree in any subject or have relevant work experience.
Relying on data, our Intelligence Analyst’s play a crucial role in keeping the country safe. It can be complex, but understanding it is key to the success of our operations. And if you think you know what sort of person works in data, think again. On our Intelligence and Data Analyst Development Programmes, you’ll see you don’t need to be a data expert to help protect the UK - just yourself.
We have opportunities available in either MI5 or MI6.
The programme at MI5 is based in London and begins with a 3-month training period, where you’ll learn more about the organisation and our processes. Then, you’ll do 3 different analyst postings right in the heart of MI5. Over the course of 5 years and beyond, you’ll develop your technical skills, work with tools that can’t be found anywhere else, and gain experience to support a fulfilling and rewarding career in analysis.
If you choose the programme at MI6, you’ll work for MI6 but be based in Cheltenham for the first two years before moving to London. You’ll join a multi-organisational analysis team, playing a vital role in turning raw data into intelligence to help keep our country safe. Your first six months on the programme will include a mixture of formal training in technical and analytical tools as well as on the job learning.
For more information, please visit the Intelligence and Data Analyst Development Programme on our website.
The application window for the Intelligence and Data Analyst Programme will open on 6th February 2023. In the meantime, we are looking for individuals who are from an Ethnic Minority background*, to register their interest in this forthcoming opportunity. As part of the registration of interest, you will be invited to an online event prior to the campaign opening.
Please note that a registration of interest does not constitute a job application, nor will such registration have any bearing upon the recruitment process itself. Any individuals who register their interest and who decide subsequently to apply to the Intelligence and Data Analyst Development Programmes, will need to complete an application form once the window for applications has opened.

We are confining registrations of interest to those from an Ethnic Minority background only, due to their current under-representation in our workforce. Once the application window has opened, we will welcome applications from all candidates, regardless of their ethnic background, gender, disability and/or any other characteristic(s). All applications will be assessed solely on merit.

We work together to safeguard Britain’s people, interests and businesses from various threats at home, overseas and online. To do that, we rely on data. On our Intelligence Data Analyst Development Programmes in either agency you’ll see you don’t need to be a data expert to help protect the UK - just yourself. Our operations are hugely varied, which is why increasing the diversity of our people is needed more than ever before.
To protect the UK, we need people with different perspectives and backgrounds. There’s no one ‘type’ of person we recruit. You don’t need to have coding or programming skills, but you’ll have some experience analysing data and will be keen to develop your abilities further with our support and training. You’ll have (or be expecting) a 2:2 degree in any subject or have relevant work experience.
Relying on data, our Intelligence Analyst’s play a crucial role in keeping the country safe. It can be complex, but understanding it is key to the success of our operations. And if you think you know what sort of person works in data, think again. On our Intelligence and Data Analyst Development Programmes, you’ll see you don’t need to be a data expert to help protect the UK - just yourself.
We have opportunities available in either MI5 or MI6.
The programme at MI5 is based in London and begins with a 3-month training period, where you’ll learn more about the organisation and our processes. Then, you’ll do 3 different analyst postings right in the heart of MI5. Over the course of 5 years and beyond, you’ll develop your technical skills, work with tools that can’t be found anywhere else, and gain experience to support a fulfilling and rewarding career in analysis.
If you choose the programme at MI6, you’ll work for MI6 but be based in Cheltenham for the first two years before moving to London. You’ll join a multi-organisational analysis team, playing a vital role in turning raw data into intelligence to help keep our country safe. Your first six months on the programme will include a mixture of formal training in technical and analytical tools as well as on the job learning.
For more information, please visit the Intelligence and Data Analyst Development Programme on our website.
The application window for the Intelligence and Data Analyst Programme will open on 6th February 2023. In the meantime, we are looking for individuals who are from an Ethnic Minority background*, to register their interest in this forthcoming opportunity. As part of the registration of interest, you will be invited to an online event prior to the campaign opening.
Please note that a registration of interest does not constitute a job application, nor will such registration have any bearing upon the recruitment process itself.

HMRC transformation
HM Revenue and Customs is currently going through an exciting ten-year transformation programme to create a tax authority fit for the future. As part of this, we are committed to providing high-quality jobs and giving employees a great place to work, whichever location you work from.
HM Revenue and Customs has made significant progress with its plans to locate in 14 large, modern, flexible offices, equipped with high-speed digital infrastructure supporting improved customer service and compliance activity. These collaborative workspaces will enable smarter working and great training and development facilities, allowing for the sharing of expertise, local training, promotion, and provide great ongoing career development opportunities.
These offices will be located in central locations in the following towns and cities close to accessible transport links: Glasgow, Edinburgh, Belfast, Newcastle, Leeds, Liverpool, Manchester, Nottingham, Birmingham, Bristol, Cardiff, Croydon, Portsmouth and Stratford.
In addition, there will also be a small number of specialist sites where the work cannot be done anywhere else, in Gartcosh (near Glasgow), Telford, Ipswich, Worthing and Dover, as well as our headquarters in central London. What’s more, our Welsh language service has people located in Porthmadog, as well as Cardiff.
We are letting you know about our future plans because if you are recruited into an office that is not one of these locations, you will be expected, subject to HM Revenue and Customs applicable policies, to move to one of these locations in the future. In some cases, this will be via one of our nine transitional sites.
For more information please contact the vacancy holder.
Terms and Conditions
We really hope you decide to apply for this role. If you’re successful you need to know that in February 2021 members of recognised trade unions (ARC and PCS) voted to approve a pay and contract reform offer. This means that HMRC will adopt new terms and conditions for all colleagues as part of a multi-year pay deal and contract offer, the pay deal period is 01 June 2020 – 31st May 2023 and terms and conditions changes take place from the 01 June 2021 onwards. These terms will apply to colleagues who already work in HMRC and if you join us, it will apply to you too. We’ve put together a summary of the key changes that will be made and you can find this attached to the Job Advert.
Pay
If you are currently working for an OGD and would like to consider the impact on your pay when joining HMRC, please see the attached document ""Pay on Transfer from OGD"" for further information. (Please note the attached document could also be called “Combined T&C and OGD Pay English”)
New entrants are expected to join on the minimum of the pay band.
Further Information
Customer facing roles in HMRC require the ability to converse at ease with members of the public and provide advice in accurate spoken English and/or Welsh where required. Where this is an essential requirement this will be tested as part of the selection process.

Any move to HMRC from another employer will mean you can no longer access childcare vouchers. This includes moves between government departments. You may however be eligible for other government schemes, including Tax Free Childcare. Determine your eligibility here.
HMRC welcomes applications from those who need to work a more flexible arrangement and will agree to requests where possible, taking into account our operational and customer service needs. We can’t guarantee that we can meet all requests to work flexibly, as agreement will be subject to business ability to accommodate, and any request to work a more flexible arrangement should be made prior to your acceptance of the provisional offer.

The Data and Statistics Division (DSD), part of the Data and Analytics Transformation (DAT) Directorate, is the division with responsibilities that span production and management of some of the Bank’s core datasets. The directorate more broadly is responsible for aspects of data management and data culture that reach into the working lives of almost all Bank staff. This is a time of significant change as the way we collect and manage data, and compile statistics, evolves in the light of the use of new technology with DAT at the forefront. The change draws on a wide range of skill sets, including: data management; data science; operational work; subject matter expertise in aspects of economics, statistics and banking and insurance supervision; and people and process management. The roles are in the Financial Statistics Group (FSG) whose focus is on the analysis, compilation, and publication of key statistical outputs such as monetary financial institutions’ contribution to the National Accounts, International Banking Statistics, and capital issuance.
Data compiled by FSG are used by the ONS and a variety of international organisations, including the Eurostat, BIS, IMF, and more, and feature in headline UK statistics such as the Gross Domestic Product, Balance of Payments, and UK Trade. FSG has made good progress building skills in data science applications, such as R and Tableau, in order to build new tools to better carry out the work of the group. This experience will contribute to wider divisional and directorate work, including the large project that DSD is undertaking to replace and upgrade its in-house database.

These have been used to deliver tangible benefits for the groups’ production work to date, and further examples are always being sought. Roles in FSG provide a good opportunity for candidates who are interested in working in a live, high profile operational area of the Bank.
The role will involve working to strict deadlines, quality assuring, compiling, and analysing data that feed in to a variety of statistics produced by FSG. Successful candidates will have an inquisitive mind able to understand developments in the economy affect data submitted by firms, identify inconsistencies and teasing out market intelligence that will be of interest across the Bank. The role will also involve project work, which can range from developing and improving processes or creating new analytical tools, to reviewing data methodology or conceptual pieces of analysis. As the role is part of team, good interpersonal and team working are required, as well the ability to communicate effectively.

HM Revenue and Customs has made significant progress with its plans to locate in 14 large, modern, flexible offices, equipped with high-speed digital infrastructure supporting improved customer service and compliance activity.

We work together to safeguard Britain’s people, interests and businesses from various threats at home, overseas and online. To do that, we rely on data. On our Intelligence Data Analyst Development Programmes in either agency you’ll see you don’t need to be a data expert to help protect the UK - just yourself. Our operations are hugely varied, which is why increasing the diversity of our people is needed more than ever before.
To protect the UK, we need people with different perspectives and backgrounds. There’s no one ‘type’ of person we recruit. You don’t need to have coding or programming skills, but you’ll have some experience analysing data and will be keen to develop your abilities further with our support and training. You’ll have (or be expecting) a 2:2 degree in any subject or have relevant work experience.
Relying on data, our Intelligence Analyst’s play a crucial role in keeping the country safe. It can be complex, but understanding it is key to the success of our operations. And if you think you know what sort of person works in data, think again. On our Intelligence and Data Analyst Development Programmes, you’ll see you don’t need to be a data expert to help protect the UK - just yourself.
We have opportunities available in either MI5 or MI6.
The programme at MI5 is based in London and begins with a 3-month training period, where you’ll learn more about the organisation and our processes. Then, you’ll do 3 different analyst postings right in the heart of MI5. Over the course of 5 years and beyond, you’ll develop your technical skills, work with tools that can’t be found anywhere else, and gain experience to support a fulfilling and rewarding career in analysis.
If you choose the programme at MI6, you’ll work for MI6 but be based in Cheltenham for the first two years before moving to London. You’ll join a multi-organisational analysis team, playing a vital role in turning raw data into intelligence to help keep our country safe. Your first six months on the programme will include a mixture of formal training in technical and analytical tools as well as on the job learning.

Any individuals who register their interest and who decide subsequently to apply to the Intelligence and Data Analyst Development Programmes, will need to complete an application form once the window for applications has opened.

We are confining registrations of interest to those from an Ethnic Minority background only, due to their current under-representation in our workforce.
